            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE CHARACTER OF <hi>POLYBIUS,</hi> AND HIS WRITINGS.</head>
                  <p>THE worthy Author of this Tranſlation, who is very much my Friend, was pleas'd to intruſt it in my Hands, for many Months together, before he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd it; deſiring me to review the Engliſh, and to Correct what I found amiſs; which he needed not have done, if his Modeſty wou'd have given him leave, to have relied on his own Abilities; who is ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of our Stile and Language, as the World will acknowledge him to be, after the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Excellent Verſion. 'Tis true,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:61906:3"/>that <hi>Polybius</hi> has formerly appear'd in an Engliſh Dreſs; but under ſuch a Cloud of Errours, in his firſt Tranſlation, that his native Beauty, was not only hidden, but his Sence perverted, in many places; ſo that he appear'd unlike himſelf, and unworthy of that Eſteem, which has always been paid him by Antiquity, as the moſt Sincere, the Cleareſt, and moſt Inſtructive of all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. He is now not only redeem'd from thoſe Miſtakes, but alſo reſtor'd to the firſt purity of his Conceptions: And the Stile in which he now ſpeaks is as plain and unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as that he wrote. I had only the pleaſure of Reading him, in a fair Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, without the toil of Alteration: At leaſt it was ſo very inconſiderable, that it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coſt me the daſh of a Pen in ſome few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe of very ſmall importance; ſo much had the Care, the Diligence, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of my Friend prevented my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he left me not the occaſion of ſerving him in a Work which was already finiſh'd to my Hands: I doubt not but the Reader will approve my Judgment. So happy it is for a good Author, to fall into the hands of a Tranſlator, who is of a Genius like his own; who has added Experience to his natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; who has been Educated in Buſineſs, of ſeveral kinds; has Travell'd, like his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, into many Parts of the World, and ſome of them the ſame with the preſent
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:61906:3"/>Scene of Hiſtory; has been employed in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the like nature, with <hi>Polybius;</hi> and like him is perfectly acquainted, not only with the Terms of the Mathematicks, but has ſearch'd into the bottom of that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Science, and reduc'd into Practice the moſt uſeful Rules of it, to his own Honour, and the Benefit of his Native Country; who, beſides theſe Advantages, poſſeſſes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Shipping and Navigation; and, in few Words, is not ignorant of any thing that concerns the Tacticks: So that here, from the beginning, we are ſure of finding nothing that is not throughly Underſtood. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is clear, and the Words adequate to the Subject. Nothing in the Matter will be miſtaken; nothing of the Terms will be miſapplied: All is natural, and proper; and he who underſtands good Sence and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, will be profited by the firſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the latter. This is what may be juſtly ſaid in Commendation of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator, and without the note of Flattery to a Friend.</p>
                  <p>As for his Author, I ſhall not be aſham'd to Copy from the Learned <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> (who has Tranſlated him into Latine,) many things which I had not from my own ſmall Reading, and which I cou'd not, without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, have drawn but from his Fountain, not omitting ſome, which came caſually in my way, by reading the Preface of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:61906:4"/>
                     <hi>Pichon,</hi> to the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s <hi>Tacitus,</hi> an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and moſt uſeful Work; which Helps, I ingeniouſly profeſs, to have receiv'd from them, both to clear my ſelf from being a Plagiary of their Writings, and to give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by their Names, to the weakneſs of my own Performance.</p>
                  <p>The taking of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, fell into the latter times of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth; a Pope not only ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of good Letters, and particularly of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, but alſo a great Encourager of it in others. From the dreadful Overthrow of that City, and final Subverſion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, many Learned Men eſcap'd, and brought over with them into <hi>Italy,</hi> that Treaſure of ancient Authors, which by their unhappineſs we now poſſeſs. And amongſt the reſt, ſome of theſe remaining Fragments of <hi>Polybius.</hi> The Body of this Hiſtory, as he left it finiſh'd, was conſiſting of Forty Books, of which the eighth Part is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to us, entire. As for his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when he was ſent Ambaſſador, either from his own Counttry-men, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> or afterwards was employed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> on their Buſineſs with other Nations, we are obliged to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great, for their Preſervation; for that Emperour was ſo much in Love with the dexterous Management, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Author, that he caus'd them all
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:61906:4"/>to be faithfully Tranſcrib'd, and made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Uſe of them in his own Diſpatches and Affairs with Foreign Princes, as his beſt Guides in his Concernments with them. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi> as you will find in reading of him, though he principally intended the Hiſtory of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Eſtabliſhment of their Empire, over the greateſt part of the World, which was then known; yet had in his Eye the general Hiſtory of the Times in which he liv'd, not forgetting either the Wars of his own Country, with their Neighbours of <hi>Etolia,</hi> or the concurrent Affairs of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> and the Provinces of <hi>Greece,</hi> (which is properly ſo call'd;) nor the Monarchies of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor the Republick of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> with the ſeveral Traverſes of their Fortunes, either in relation to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or independent to the Wars, which they wag'd with them, beſides what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and other <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Countries. The Time which is taken up in this Hiſtory conſiſts of Three and Fifty Years, and the greaſt part of it is employ'd in the deſcription of thoſe Events, of which the Author was an Eye-witneſs, or bore a conſiderable part in the Conduct of them. But in what particular Time or Age it was, when Mankind receiv'd that irrecoverable Loſs of this Noble Hiſtory, is not certainly deliver'd to us. It appears to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by what I
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:61906:5"/>have already noted; and neither <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> nor any other, can give us any further Account concerning it. The firſt Attempt towards a Tranſlation of him, was by Command of the ſame Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth, already mention'd, who eſteem'd him the Prince of Greek Hiſtorians: Wou'd have him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in his Hands; and us'd to make this Judgment of him; That, if he yielded to one or two, in the Praiſe of Eloquence, yet in Wiſdom, and all other Accompliſhments belonging to a perfect Hiſtorian, he was at leaſt equal to any other Writer, <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> and perhaps excell'd them all. This is the Author, who is now offer'd to us in our Mother Tongue, recommended by the Nobility of his Birth, by his Inſtitution in Arts and Sciences, by his Knowledge in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Moral Philoſophy, and particularly the Politicks; by his being converſant both in the Arts of Peace and War; by his Education under his Father <hi>Lycortas,</hi> who voluntarily depos'd himſelf from his Soveraignty of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolis,</hi> to become a principal Member of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Commonwealth, which then flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd under the management of <hi>Aratus,</hi> by his friendſhip with <hi>Scipio Affricanus,</hi> who ſubdued <hi>Carthage,</hi> to whom he was both a Companion and a Conſellour; and by the Good-will, Eſteem, and Intimacy which he had with ſeveral Princes of <hi>Aſia, Greece</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> during his Life; and after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:61906:5"/>by deſerving the Applauſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all ſucceeding Ages. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſo long neglected in the barbarous times of Chriſtianity, and ſo little known in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> (according to the Fate which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly follows the beſt of Writers) was pull'd from under the Rubbiſh which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him, by the Learned Biſhop, <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> the Fifth. And ſome parts of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, (for, with all his Diligence, he was not able to recover the whole) were by him recommended to a Perſon (knowing both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Tongues, and learn'd for the Times in which he liv'd) to be Tranſlated into Latin: And, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our <hi>Polybius,</hi> he was amongſt the firſt of the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, who deſerv'd to have this Care beſtow'd on him. Which notwithſtanding, ſo many Hindrances oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd in this Attempt, that the Work was not perfected in his Popedome, neither was any more than a third Part of what is now recover'd in his Hands; neither did that learn'd <hi>Italian,</hi> who had undertaken him, ſucceed very happily in that Endeavour; for the perfect Knowledge of the Greek Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was not yet reſtor'd; and that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator was but as a one-ey'd Man, amongſt the Nation of the Blind, only ſuffer'd, till a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be found, to do right to an Author, whoſe Excellence requir'd a more juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, than the Ignorance of that Age
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:61906:6"/>afforded. And this gives me occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, (ſays <hi>Caſaubon,</hi>) that in following Times, when Eloquence was redeem'd, and the Knowledge of the Greek Language flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, yet no Man thought of purſuing that Deſign, which was ſo worthily begun, in thoſe firſt Rudiments of Learning. Some indeed, of almoſt every Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> have been inſtrumental in the recovery of ſeveral loſt Parts of our <hi>Polybius,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on them with good Succeſs; but no Man before <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> had review'd the firſt Tranſlation, corrected its Errours, and put the laſt Hand to its Accompliſhment. The World is therefore beholding to him for this great Work; for he has collected into one their ſeattered Fragments, has piec'd them together, according to the natural Order in which they were Written; made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to Scholars, and render'd the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlator's Task more eaſie to his Hands. Our Author is particularly mention'd, with great Honour, by <hi>Cicero, Strabo, Joſephus,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch;</hi> and in what rank of Writers they are plac'd, none of the Learned need to be inform'd: He is copied in whole Books together by <hi>Livy,</hi> commonly eſteem'd the Prince of the Roman Hiſtory, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated word for word: Tho' the Latin Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian is not to be excus'd, for not mentioning the Man to whom he had been ſo much oblig'd, nor for taking as his own the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:61906:6"/>Labours of another. <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> who preferr'd the Freedom of his Country to the Obligations which he had to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> ſo priz'd <hi>Polybius,</hi> that he made a Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of his Works, and Read him not only for his Inſtruction, but for the Diverſion of his Grief, when his noble Enterpriſe for the Reſtoration of the Commonwealth had not found the Succeſs which it deſerv'd. And this is not the leaſt Commendation of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that he, who was not wholly ſatisfied with the Eloquence of <hi>Tully,</hi> ſhou'd Epitomize <hi>Polybius,</hi> with his own Hand. It was on the Conſideration of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and the Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he paid him, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great took ſo great a pleaſure in Reading our Author, and collecting the ſeveral Treaties of his Embaſſies; of which, tho' many are now loſt, yet thoſe which remain are a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Teſtimony of his Abilities; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate my Country, that a Prince of our Extraction, (as was <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) has the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of obliging the Chriſtian World, by theſe Remainders of our great Hiſtorian. 'Tis now time to enter into the particular Praiſes of <hi>Polybius,</hi> which I have given you before, in groſs; and the firſt of them, (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Method of <hi>Caſaubon,</hi>) is his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Skill in Political Affairs. I had Read him in Engliſh, with the pleaſure of a Boy, before I was ten Years of Age; and yet, even then, had ſome dark Notions of the
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:61906:7"/>Prudence with which he conducted his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; particularly in making me known, and almoſt ſee the Places where ſuch and ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were perform'd. This was the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which I was then capable of making, betwixt him and other Hiſtorians, which I Read early. But when being of a riper Age, I took him again into my Hands; I muſt needs ſay, that I have profited more by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, than by <hi>Thucydides, Appian, Dion Caſſius,</hi> and all the reſt of the Greek Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians together: And amongſt all the <hi>Romans,</hi> none have reach'd him in this particular, but <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who is equal with him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis wonderful to conſider, with how much care and application he Inſtructs, Counſels, Warns, Admoniſhes and Adviſes, whenſoever he can find a fit occaſion: He performs all theſe ſometimes in the nature of a common Parent of Mankind; and ſometimes alſo limits his Inſtructions to particular Nations, by a friendly Reproach of thoſe Failings and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, to which they were moſt obnoxious. In this laſt manner, he gives Inſtructions to the <hi>Mantinaeans,</hi> the <hi>Elaeans,</hi> and ſeveral other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Greece;</hi> by informing them of ſuch things as were conducing to their Welfare. Thus he likewiſe warns the <hi>Romans</hi> of their Obſtinacy and Wilfulneſs; Vices, which have often brought them to the brink of Ruine. And thus he frequently exhorts the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general, not to depart from their
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:61906:7"/>Dependence on the <hi>Romans;</hi> nor to take falſe Meaſures by embroiling themſelves in Wars with that Victorious People, in whoſe Fate it was to be Maſters of the Univerſe. But as his peculiar Concernment was for the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own Country-men, the <hi>Achaians,</hi> he more than once inſinuates to them, the care of their Preſervation, which conſiſted in ſubmitting to the Yoke of the <hi>Roman</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which they could not poſſibly avoid; and to make it Eaſie to them, by a chearful compliance with their Commands, rather than unprofitably to Oppoſe them, with the hazard of thoſe remaining Priviledges, which the Clemency of the Conquerours had left them. For this reaſon, in the whole Courſe of his Hiſtory, he makes it his chiefeſt buſineſs to perſwade the <hi>Grecians</hi> in general, that the growing Greatneſs and Fortune of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire was not owing to meer Chance, but to the Conduct and invincible Courage of that People; to whom their own Virtue gave the Dominion of the World. And yet this Councellor of Patience and Submiſſion, as long as there was any probability of hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, to withſtand the progreſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fortune; was not wanting to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power to reſiſt them, at leaſt to deferr the Bondage of his Country, which he had long foreſeen: But the Fates inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly drawing all things into ſubjection to <hi>Rome,</hi> this well-deſerving Citizen was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:61906:8"/>to appear in that City, where he ſuffer'd the Impriſonment of many Years: Yet even then his Virtue was beneficial to him; the knowledge of his Learning and his Wiſdom, procuring him the friendſhip of the moſt Potent in the Senate; ſo that it may be ſaid, with <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> that the ſame Virtue which had brought him into diſtreſs, was the very means of his relief, and of his exaltation to greater Dignities than thoſe which he loſt: For by the interceſſion of <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor, <hi>Scipio Emilianus,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards deſtroy'd <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſome other principal Noblemen, our <hi>Polybius</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to Liberty. After which, having ſet it down as a Maxim, that the Welfare of the <hi>Achaians</hi> conſiſted, as I have ſaid, in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own ſtubborn Inclinations, and yielding up that Freedom which they no longer could maintain, he made it the utmoſt aim of his Endeavours, to bring over his Countrymen to that Perſwaſion: in which, though to their Misfortunes, his Counſels were not prevalent, yet thereby he not only prov'd himſelf a good Patriot, but alſo made his Fortunes with the <hi>Romans.</hi> For his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, by their own unpardonable Fault, not long afterwards, drew on themſelves their own Deſtruction: For when <hi>Mummius,</hi> in the <hi>Achaian</hi> War, made a final Conqueſt of that Country; he diſſolv'd the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of their Commonwealth. But in the
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:61906:8"/>mean time, <hi>Polybius</hi> enjoy'd that tranquility of Fortune, which he had purchas'd by his Wiſdom. In that private State, being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly dear to <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius,</hi> and ſome of the reſt who were then in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Government: And that Favour which he had gain'd amongſt them, he employed not in heaping Riches to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but as a means of performing many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Actions; as particularly, when <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> was ſent to demoliſh <hi>Carthage,</hi> he went along with him, in the nature of a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and Companion of his Enterpriſe. At which time, receiving the Command of a Fleet from him, he made Diſcoveries in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of the Atlantick Ocean; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the Shores of <hi>Africa:</hi> And doing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Offices to all ſorts of People, whom he had power to Oblige, eſpecially to the Grecians, who in Honour of their Benefactor, caus'd many Statues of him to be erected; as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> has Written. The particular Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the <hi>Locrians</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> is alſo an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Witneſs of this Truth; who, by his Mediation being diſcharg'd from the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Taxes, which oppreſs'd them, through the hardſhip of thoſe Conditions which the <hi>Romans</hi> had impos'd on them in the Treaty of Peace; profeſs'd themſelves to be owing for their Lives and Fortunes, to the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and good Nature of <hi>Polybius;</hi> which they took care to Expreſs, by all manner of
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:61906:9"/>Acknowledgment. Yet as beneficent as he was, the greateſt obligement which he could lay on Humane-kind, was the Writing of this preſent Hiſtory: Wherein he has left a perpetual Monument of his publick Love to all the World, in every ſucceeding Age of it, by giving us ſuch Precepts as are moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to our common Safety, and our Benefit. This <hi>Philanthropy</hi> (which we have not a proper Word in Engliſh to expreſs) is every where manifeſt in our Author. And from hence proceeded that divine Rule which he gave to <hi>Scipio,</hi> that whenſoever he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, he ſhould take care not to return to his own Houſe, before he had acquir'd a Friend, by ſome new Obligement. To this Excellency of Nature we owe the Treaſure which is contain'd in this moſt uſeful Work: This is the Standard by which all good and prudent Princes ought to regulate their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: None have more need of Friends than Monarchs. And though Ingratitude is too frequent, in the moſt of thoſe who are Oblig'd; yet Incouragement will work on generous Minds; and if the Experiment be loſt on Thouſands, yet it never fails on All. And one vertuous Man in a whole Nation is worth the buying; as one Diamond is worth the ſearch in a heap of Rubbiſh. But a narrow-licarted Prince, who thinks that Mankind is made for him alone, puts his Subjects in a way of deſerting him on the firſt Occaſion;
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:61906:9"/>and teaches them to be as ſparing of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he is of his Bounty. He is ſure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Enemies, who will not be at the coſt of rewarding his Friends and Servants. And by letting his People ſee he loves them not, inſtructs them to live upon the ſquare with him, and to make him ſenſible in his turn, that Prerogatives are given, but Priviledges are inherent. As for Tricking, Cunning, and that which in Soveraigns they call King-craft, and Reaſon of State in Commonwealths: To them and their Proceedings <hi>Polybius</hi> is an open Enemy. He ſeverely repoves all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Practices, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Policy, which is too frequent in the management of the Publick. He commends nothing but Plainneſs, Sincerity, and the Common-good, undiſguis'd, and ſet in a true Light, before the People: Not but that there may be a Neceſſity of ſaving a Nation, by going beyond the Letter of the Law, or even ſometimes by ſuperſeding it; but then that Neceſſity muſt not be Artificial, it muſt be Viſible, it muſt be ſtrong enough to make the Remedy not only pardon'd, but deſir'd, to the major part of the People: Not for the Intereſt only of ſome few Men, but for the Publick-ſafety, for otherwiſe, one Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Law, draws after it the practice of ſubverting all the Liberties of a Nation, which are only intruſted with any Government; but can never be given up to it. The beſt
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:61906:10"/>way to diſtinguiſh betwixt a pretended Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and a true, is to obſerve if the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be rarely apply'd, or frequently. In times of Peace, or times of War and publick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, which are the moſt uſual Cauſes of ſuddain Neceſſities. From hence <hi>Caſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> infers, That this our Author, who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Vertue, and Probity, and Plain-dealing, ought to be ſtudied principally by Kings and Miniſters of State: And that Youth, which are bred up to ſucceed in the management of Buſineſs, ſhould read him carefully, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe him throughly, deteſting the Maxims that are given by <hi>Machiavel</hi> and others, which are only the Inſtruments of Tyranny, Further-more, (continues he) the ſtudy of Truth is perpetually joyn'd with the love of Virtue: For there is no Virtue which derives not its original from Truth: As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is no Vice which has not its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from a Lye. Truth is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Knowledge, and the cement of all Societies. And this is one of the moſt ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Qualities in our Author. I was ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of this myſelf, in the peruſual of the preſent Hiſtory, that I confeſs, amongſt all the Ancients, I never found any who had the Air of it ſo much; and amongſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, none but <hi>Philip de Commines.</hi> They had this common to them, that they both chang'd their Maſters: But <hi>Polybius</hi> chang'd not his ſide, as <hi>Philip</hi> did: He was not
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:61906:10"/>bought off to another Party; but purſu'd the true Intereſt of his Country, even when he ſerv'd the <hi>Romans.</hi> Yet ſince Truth, (as one of the Philoſophers has told me) lies in the bottom of a Well; ſo 'tis hard to draw it up: much Pains, much Diligence, much Judgment is neceſſary to hand it to us, even Coſt is oftentimes requir'd; and <hi>Polybius</hi> was wanting in none of theſe. We find but few Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of all Ages, who have been diligent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in their ſearch for Truth: 'tis their common method to take on truſt what they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute to the Publick; by which means a Falſhood once receiv'd from a fam'd Writer, becomes traditional to Poſterity. But <hi>Polybius</hi> weigh'd the Authors from whom he was forc'd to borrow the Hiſtory of the Times immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceding his; and oftentimes corrected them, either by comparing them each with other, or by the Lights which he had receiv'd from ancient Men of known Integrity amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had been converſant in thoſe Affairs, which were then manag'd, and were yet living to Inſtruct him. He alſo learn'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue, and attain'd to that knowledge of their Laws, their Rights, their Cuſtoms and Antiquities, that few of their own Citizens underſtood them better; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gain'd permiſſion from the Senate, to ſearch the Capitol, he made himſelf familiar with their Records, and afterwards tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them into his Mother-tongue. So that he
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:61906:11"/>taught the Noblemen of <hi>Rome</hi> their own Municipal Laws, and was accounted more skilful in them than <hi>Fabius Pictor,</hi> a Man of the Senatorian Order, who wrote the Tranſactions of the <hi>Punick</hi> Wars. He who neglected none of the Laws of Hiſtory, was ſo careful of Truth, (which is the principal,) that he made it his whole Buſineſs to deliver nothing to Poſterity, which might deceive them; and by that Diligence and Exactneſs may eaſily be known to be ſtudious of Truth, and a lover of it. What therefore <hi>Brutus</hi> thought worthy to Tranſcribe with his own Hand out of him, I need not be aſham'd to Copy after him. <hi>I believe,</hi> ſays <hi>Polybius, That Nature herſelf has conſtituted Truth as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Deity, which is to be ador'd by Mankind; and that ſhe has given it greater Force than any of the reſt: For being oppos'd, as ſhe is on all ſides, and appearances of Truth ſo often paſſing for the thing itſelf, in behalf of plauſible Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods; yet, by her wonderful Operation, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates herſelf into the Minds of Men; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exerting her Strength immediately, and ſometimes lying hid in Darkneſs for length of time; but at last ſhe ſtruggles through it, and appears Triumphant over Falſhood.</hi> This ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity <hi>Polybius</hi> preferr'd to all his Friends, and even to his Father; <hi>In all other Offices of Life,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I praiſe a lover of his Friends, and of his Native Country; but in writing Hiſtory, I am oblig'd to divest myſelf of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:61906:11"/>Obligations, and ſacrifice them all to Truth. Aratus,</hi> the <hi>Sicyonian,</hi> in the Childhood of our Author, was chief of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; a Man in principal Eſteem, both in his own Country, and all the Provinces of <hi>Greece;</hi> admir'd univerſally for his Probity, his Wiſdom, his juſt Adminiſtration, and his Conduct: In remembrance of all which his grateful Country-men, after his Deceaſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd him thoſe Honours which are only due to Heroes. Him our <hi>Polybius</hi> had in Veneration, and form'd himſelf by imitation of his Vertues; and is never wanting in his Commendations through the courſe of his Hiſtory. Yet, even this Man, when the cauſe of Truth requir'd it, is many times reprov'd by him, for his ſlowneſs in Counſel, his tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in the beginning of his Enterpriſes, his tedious, and more than Spaniſh Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and his heavy and cowardly Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are as freely blam'd by our <hi>Polybius,</hi> as they were afterwards by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs drew his Character from this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In plain Terms, that wiſe General ſcarce ever perform'd any great Action but by Night. The glittering of a Sword before his Face was offenſive to his Eyes: Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor therefore boldly accuſes him of his Faint-heartedneſs; attributes the Defeat at <hi>Caphiae</hi> wholly to him, and is not ſparing to affirm, That all <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> was fill'd with Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies, which were ſet up, as the Monuments
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:61906:12"/>of his Loſſes. He ſometimes Praiſes, and at other times Condemns the Proceedings of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> according to the Occaſions which he gave him, by the variety and inequality of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and this moſt exquiſite on either ſide.</p>
                  <p>He more than once Arraigns him for the inconſtancy of his Judgment: And chapters even his own <hi>Aratus,</hi> on the ſame Head; ſhewing by many Examples, produc'd from their Actions, how many Miſeries they had both occaſion'd to the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting it to the weakneſs of humane Nature, which can make nothing perfect. But ſome Men are brave in Battel, who are weak in Counſel, which daily Experience ſets before our Eyes, others deliberate wiſely, but are weak in the performing part; and even no Man is the ſame to Day which he was Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, or may be to Morrow. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. ſays our Author, <hi>a good Man is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times liable to Blame, and a bad Man, though not often, may poſſibly deſerve to be Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And for this very reaſon he ſeverely tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <hi>Timaeus,</hi> a malicious Hiſtorian, who will allow no kind of Vertue to <hi>Agathocles</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Sicily;</hi> but detracts from all his Actions, even the moſt Glorious, becauſe in general he was a vicious Man. <hi>Is it to be thought,</hi> ſays <hi>Caſaubon, that</hi> Polybius <hi>loved the Memory of</hi> Agathocles <hi>the Tyrant, or hated that of the Vertuous</hi> Aratus? But 'tis one thing
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:61906:12"/>to commend a Tyrant, and another thing to overpaſs in ſilence, thoſe laudable Actions which are perform'd by him: Becauſe it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues an Author of the ſame Falſhood, to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termit, what has actually been done, as to feign thoſe Actions which have never been. It will not be unprofitable in this place, to give another famous Inſtance of the Candour and Integrity of our Hiſtorian. There had been an ancient League betwixt the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Achaia</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was entertain'd by both Parties, ſometimes on the ſame Conditions, and ſometimes alſo the Confederacy was renew'd on other Terms. It happen'd in the 148th Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, that <hi>Ptolomy Epiphanes,</hi> on this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſent one <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Ambaſſadour to the Common-wealth of <hi>Achaia.</hi> That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick was then ruinouſly divided into two Factions: whereof the Heads on one ſide, were <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> and <hi>Lycortas</hi> the Father of our Author; of the adverſe Party, the Chief was <hi>Ariſtaenus,</hi> with ſome other principal <hi>Achaians.</hi> The Faction of <hi>Philopoemen</hi> was prevalent in the Council, for renewing the Confederacy with the King of <hi>Egypt:</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, <hi>Lycortas</hi> receiv'd a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go to that Court, and treat the Articles of Alliance. Accordingly he goes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards returns, and gives Account to his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, that the Treaty was concluded. <hi>Ariſtaenus,</hi> hearing nothing but a bare Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:61906:13"/>of a League that was made, without any thing belonging to the Conditions of it, and well knowing that ſeveral forms of thoſe Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances had been us'd in the former Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ask'd <hi>Lycortas</hi> in the Concil, according to which of them this preſent Confederacy was made? To this Queſtion of his Enemy, <hi>Lycortas</hi> had not a word to anſwer. For it had ſo happen'd by the wonderful neglect of <hi>Philopoemen</hi> and his own, and alſo that of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi>'s Counſellors; or, as I rather believe, by their Craft contriv'd, that the whole Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action had been looſly and confuſedly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, which, in a Matter of ſo great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, redounded to the Scandal and Ignominy of <hi>Philopoemen</hi> and <hi>Lycortas,</hi> in the Face of that grave Aſſembly. Now theſe Proceedings our Author ſo relates, as if he had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Perſons to whom he had no manner of relation, tho' one of them was his own Father, and the other always eſteem'd by him in the place of a better Father. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mindful of the Law which himſelf had inſtituted, concerning the indiſpenſible Duty of an Hiſtorian, (which is Truth) he choſe rather to be thought a lover of it, than of either of his Parents. 'Tis true, <hi>Lycortas</hi> in all probability was dead, when <hi>Polybius</hi> wrote this Hiſtory; but had he been then living, we may ſafely think that his Son wou'd have aſſum'd the ſame Liberty, and not fear'd to have offended him in behalf of Truth.
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:61906:13"/>Another part of this Veracity is alſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the notice of the Reader, tho', at the ſame time, we muſt conclude, that it was alſo an effect of a ſound Judgment; that he perpetually explodes the Legends of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and Miracles, and inſtead of them, moſt accurately ſearches into the natural Cauſes, of thoſe Actions which he deſcribes; for, from the firſt of theſe, the latter follows of direct conſequence. And for this reaſon he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an immortal Enmity to thoſe Tricks and Jugglings, which the Common-people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as real Miracles, becauſe they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Cauſes which produc'd them. But he had made a diligent Search into them, and found out that they preceeded either from the fond Credulity of the People, or were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on them by the Craft of thoſe whoſe Intereſt it was that they ſhould be believ'd. You hear not in <hi>Polybius,</hi> that it Rain'd Blood, or Stones; that a Bull had Spoken, or a thouſand ſuch Impoſſibilities, with which <hi>Livy</hi> perpetually crowds the Calends of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Conſulſhip. His New Years could no more begin without them, during his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Punick</hi> Wars, than our Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticating Almanacks without the Effects of the preſent Oppoſitions betwixt <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the foretelling of Comets and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſcations in the Air, which ſeldom happen at the times aſſign'd by our Aſtrologers, and almoſt always fail in their Events. If you
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:61906:14"/>will give Credit to ſome other Authors, ſome God was always preſent with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi> to direct their Actions: That a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deity wrought Journey-work under <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> to conduct him through the difficult Paſſages of the Alpes; and another did the ſame Office of Drudgery for <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he Beſieg'd New <hi>Carthage,</hi> by draining the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which otherwiſe wou'd have drown'd his Army, in their raſh Approaches. Which <hi>Polybius</hi> obſerving, ſays wittily and truly, That the Authors of ſuch fabulous kind of Stuff, write Tragedies, not Hiſtories. For, as the Poets, when they are at a loſs for the Solution of a Plot, bungle up their Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe, with a God deſcending in a Machine: So theſe inconſiderate Hiſtorians, when they have brought their Heroes into a Plunge, by ſome raſh and headlong Undertaking, having no Humane way remaining to diſingage them with their Honour, are forc'd to have recourſe to Miracle; and introduce a God for their Deliverance. 'Tis a common Frenzy of the ignorant Multitude, ſays <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ingaging Heaven on their ſide; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a ſucceſsful Stratagem of any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to gain Authority among his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if he can perſwade them, that he is the Man by Fate appointed for ſuch, or ſuch an Action, though moſt impracticable. To be favour'd of God, and command, (if it may be permitted ſo to ſay,) the extraordinary
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:61906:14"/>concourſe of Providence, ſets off a Heroe, and makes more ſpecious the Cauſe for which he Fights, without any conſideration of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, which ought to be the beginning and end of all our Actions. For where that is violated, God is only preſent in permiſſion; and ſuffers a Wrong to be done, but not Commands it. Light Hiſtorians, and ſuch as are Superſtitious in their Natures, by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of feign'd Miracles, captivate the groſs Underſtandings of their Readers, and pleaſe their Fancies by Relations of things which are rather Wonderful than True: But ſuch as are of a more profound and ſolid Judgment, (which is the Character of our <hi>Polybius,</hi>) have recourſe only to their own natural Lights, and by them purſue the Methods at leaſt of Probability, if they cannot arrive to a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Certainty. He was ſatisfi'd that <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> was not the firſt, who had made a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the Alpes, but that the <hi>Gauls</hi> had been before him in their Deſcent on <hi>Italy;</hi> and alſo knew, that this moſt prudent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, when he laid his Deſign of Invading that Country, had made an Alliance with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and prepoſſeſs'd them in his Favour, and before he ſtirr'd a foot from <hi>Spain,</hi> had provided againſt all thoſe Difficulties which he foreſaw in his Attempt, and compaſs'd his Undertaking, which indeed was void of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but full of Conduct, and Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. In the ſame manner <hi>Scipio,</hi> before
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:61906:15"/>he departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> to take his Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> had carefully conſider'd every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtance which might croſs his Purpoſe, and made his Enterpriſe as eaſie to him as humane Prudence could provide; ſo that he was Victorious over that Nation, not by vertue of any Miracle, but by his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Forecaſt, and wiſe Conduct in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Deſign. Of which, tho' <hi>Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was not an Eye-witneſs, he yet had it from the beſt Teſtimony, which was that of <hi>Leli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the Friend of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who accompanied him in that Expedition, of whom our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with great Diligence enquir'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing of Moment, which happen'd in that War, and with whom he commends for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of which I will ſelect but ſome few Inſtances, becauſe I want Leiſure to expatiate on many. In the Fragments of the 17th Book he makes a learned Diſſertation concerning the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Phalanx, or groſs Body of Foot, which was formerly believ'd to be Invincible, till Experience taught the contrary, by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Battle, which <hi>Philip</hi> loſt to the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the manifeſt
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:61906:15"/>and moſt certain Cauſes are therein related, which prove it to be inferior to the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions. When alſo he had told us in his former Books, of the three great Battles, wherein <hi>Hannibal</hi> had Overthrown the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the laſt at <hi>Cannae,</hi> wherein he had in a manner Conquer'd that Republick, he gives the Reaſons of every Defeat, either from the Choice of Ground, or the Strength of the Foreign Horſe in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or the ill-timing of the Fight on the vanquiſh'd ſide. After this, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the turn of Fortune on the Part of the <hi>Romans,</hi> you are viſibly conducted upwards to the Cauſes of that Change; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the Method which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purſu'd by that Commonwealth, which rais'd it to the Empire of the World. In theſe and many other Examples, which for brevity are omitted, there is nothing more plain, than that <hi>Polybius</hi> denies all Power to Fortune, and places the Sum of Succeſs in Providence. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are his Words. 'Tis a Madneſs to make Fortune the Miſtreſs of Events, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in herſelf ſhe is nothing, can Rule no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but is rul'd by Prudence. So that whenever our Author ſeems to attribute any thing to Chance, he ſpeaks only with the Vulgar, and deſires ſo to be underſtood: But here I muſt make bold to part Company with <hi>Caſaubon</hi> for a Moment. He is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:61906:16"/>Friend to any Author with whom he has taken any Pains; and his Partialily to <hi>Perſius,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Juvenal,</hi> is too freſh in my Memory to be forgotten. Becauſe <hi>Polybius</hi> will allow nothing to the Power of Chance, he takes an occaſion to infer, that he believ'd a Providence, ſharply inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt thoſe who have accus'd him of Atheiſm. He makes <hi>Suidas</hi> his Second in this Quarrel, and produces his ſingle Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that but a bare Aſſertion neither without Proof, that <hi>Polybius</hi> believ'd, with us Chriſtians, God adminiſter'd all humane Actions and Affairs. But our Author will not be defended in this caſe, his whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory reclaims to that Opinion. When he ſpeaks of Providence, or of any Divine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, he is as much in jeſt, as when he ſpeaks of Fortune; 'tis all to the Capacity of the Vulgar. Prudence was the only Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity which he Worſhipp'd; and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Vertue the only End which he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. If I would have diſguis'd this to the Reader, it was not in my Power. The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which manifeſtly prove his Irreligion, are ſo obvious, that I need not quote them. Neither do I know any reaſon, why <hi>Caſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> ſhou'd in large ſo much in his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince to believe falſe Gods, and to believe none, are Errors of the ſame Importance. He who knew not our God, ſaw through the ridiculous Opinions of the Heathens concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:61906:16"/>theirs; and not being able without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, to go farther, ſtopp'd at home in his own Breaſt, and made Prudence his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, Truth his Search, and Vertue his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> like him, had follow'd Truth, he would have ſav'd me the Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pains of contradicting him: But even the Reputation of <hi>Polybius,</hi> if there were occaſion, is to be ſacrific'd to Truth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Maxim. As for the Wiſdom of our Author, whereby he wonderfully fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the Decay of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and thoſe Civil Wars which turn'd it down from a Commonwealth, to an abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: He who will take the Pains to review this Hiſtory will eaſily perceive, that <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> was of the beſt ſort of Prophets, who predict from Natural Cauſes thoſe Events, which muſt naturally proceed from them.</p>
                  <p>And theſe things were not to ſucceed even in the compaſs of the next Century to that wherein he liv'd. But the Perſon was then living, who was the firſt mover towards them; and that was that great <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> who by cajolling the People, to break the Fundamental Conſtitutions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in his Favour, by bringing him too early to the Conſulſhip, and afterwards by making their Diſcipline of War precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Firſt taught them to devolve the Power and Authority of the Senate, into the hands of one, and then to make that one to be at
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:61906:17"/>the Diſpoſition of the Souldiery; which though he practis'd at a time, when it was neceſſary for the ſafety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet it drew after it thoſe fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which not only ruin'd the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but alſo, in proceſs of time, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy it ſelf. But the Author was too much in the Intereſts of that Family, to Name <hi>Scipio;</hi> and therefore he gives other Reaſons, to which I refer the Reader, that I may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void prolixity. By what degrees <hi>Polybius</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to this heighth of Knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Judgment in Affairs, it will not be hard to make the Reader comprehend; for preſuppoſing in him, all that Birth or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could give a Man, who was form'd for the Management of great Affairs, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Recording them; he was likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd from his Youth into thoſe Employments which add Experience to Natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Being joyn'd in Commiſſion with his Father <hi>Lycortas,</hi> and the Younger <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> before the Age of Twenty, in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy to <hi>Egypt.</hi> After which he was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in the Buſineſs of his own Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or that of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that it ſeems to be one Part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Felicity, that he was Born in an Age, when their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weath was growing to the heighth, that he might be the Hiſtorian of thoſe great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were perform'd not only in his Life-time, but the chief of them even in his
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:61906:17"/>Sight. I muſt confeſs that the Preparations to his Hiſtory, (or the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> as they are call'd) are very large, and the Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, are exceeding frequent. But as to his Preparatives, they were but neceſſary, to make the Reader comprehend the Drift and Deſign of his Undertaking. And the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are alſo ſo Inſtructive, that we may truly ſay, They Tranſcend the Profit which we receive from the Matter of Fact. Upon the whole we may conclude him to be a great Talker; but we muſt grant him to be a Prudent Man. We can ſpare nothing of all he ſays, 'tis ſo much to our Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and if the reſt of his Hiſtory had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd to us, in all probability it wou'd have been more cloſe; for we can ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what was left in nature for him to add, he has ſo emptied almoſt all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-places of Digreſſions already; or if he could have added any thing, thoſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might have been as Uſeful, and as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the reſt which he has given us, and that are deſcended to our Hands. I will ſay nothing farther of the <hi>Excerpta,</hi> which (as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> thinks) are part of that Epitome, which was begun to be made by <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> but never finiſh'd; nor of thoſe Embaſſies which are collected and compil'd by the command of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great: Becauſe neither of them are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated in this Work. And whether or no
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:61906:18"/>they will be added in another Impreſſion, I am not certain. The Tranſlator of theſe Five Books having carried his Work no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than it was Perfect. He, I ſuppoſe, will acquaint you with his own Purpoſe in the Preface, which I hear he intends to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix before <hi>Polybius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now hear <hi>Polybius</hi> himſelf deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing an accompliſhed Hiſtorian, wherein we ſhall ſee his own Picture, as in a Glaſs, reflected to him, and given us afterwards to behold, in the Writing of this Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of old, That it would be happy for Mankind, if either Philoſophers admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Government, or that Governours applied themſelves to the ſtudy of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. I may alſo ſay, That it would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for Hiſtory, if thoſe who undertake, to Write it, were Men converſant in Political Affairs, who applied themſelves ſeriouſly to their Undertaking; not negligently, but as ſuch, who were fully perſwaded, that they undertook a Work of the greateſt Moment, of the greateſt Excellency, and the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Mankind: Eſtabliſhing this, as the Foundation whereon they are to Build, that they can never be capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duty, as they ought, unleſs they have form'd themſelves before-hand to their Undertaking, by Prudence, and long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Affairs; without which Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Advantages, if they attempt to
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:61906:18"/>Write a Hiſtory, they will fall into a various and endleſs Labyrinth of Errors.</p>
                  <p>When we hear this Author Speaking, we are ready to think our ſelves engag'd in a Converſation with <hi>Cato,</hi> the Cenſor, with <hi>Lelius,</hi> with <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> and with the two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, that is, with the greateſt Heroes, and moſt prudent Men of the greateſt Age, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth. This ſets me ſo on Fire, when I am Reading either here, or in any ancient Author, their Lives and Actions that I cannot hold from breaking out with <hi>Montaign,</hi> into this Expreſſion: <q>'Tis juſt, ſays he, for every honeſt Man to be Content with the Government, and Laws of his Native Country, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to alter or ſubvert them: But if I were to chooſe where I would have been Born, it ſhou'd have been in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</q> He indeed names <hi>Venice;</hi> which, for many Reaſons, ſhou'd not be my Wiſh: But, rather <hi>Rome</hi> in ſuch an Age, if it were poſſible, as that wherein <hi>Polybius</hi> liv'd; or that of <hi>Sparta,</hi> whoſe Conſtitution for a Republick, is by our Author, compar'd with <hi>Rome;</hi> to which he juſtly gives the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p>I will not undertake to compare <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus;</hi> tho', if I ſhou'd attempt it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Merits of the Cauſe, I muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to <hi>Polybius</hi> the greater Comprehenſion, and the larger Soul; to <hi>Tacitus</hi> the greater
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:61906:19"/>Eloquence, and the more cloſe Connection of his Thoughts. The Manner of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in Writing, is more like the Force and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> that of <hi>Polybius</hi> more like the Copiouſneſs, and diffuſive Character of <hi>Cicero.</hi> Amongſt Hiſtorians, <hi>Tacitus</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Thucidydes,</hi> and <hi>Polybius, Herodotus. Polybius</hi> foreſaw the Ruin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, by Luxury, Luſt, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; <hi>Tacitus</hi> foreſaw in the Cauſes, thoſe Events which ſhou'd Deſtroy the Monarchy. They are both of them, without diſpute, the beſt Hiſtorians in their ſeveral kinds. In this they are alike, that both of them ſuffer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Iniquity of the Times in which they liv'd: both their Hiſtories are diſmember'd, the greateſt part of them loſt, and they are interpolated in many places. Had their Works been perfect, we might have had longer Hiſtories, but not better. <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> according to his uſual Partiality, condemns <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that he may raiſe <hi>Polybius,</hi> who needs not any ſiniſter Artifice, to make him appear equal to the beſt. <hi>Tacitus</hi> deſcrib'd the Times of Tyranny; but he always Writes with ſome kind of Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. 'Tis not his fault, that <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Caligula, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> were bad Princes. He is accus'd of Malevolence, and of taking Actions in the worſt Sence; but we are ſtill to remember, that thoſe were the Actions of Tyrants. Had the reſt of
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:61906:19"/>his Hiſtory remain'd to us, we had certainly found a better Account of <hi>Veſpaſian, Titus, Nerva,</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> who were vertuous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; and he wou'd have given the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Actions a contrary turn. But it is not my Buſineſs to defend <hi>Tacitus;</hi> neither dare I deeide the Preſerence betwixt him and our <hi>Polybius.</hi> They are equally profitable, and inſtructive to the Reader; but <hi>Tacitus</hi> more uſeful to thoſe who are Born under a Monarchy; <hi>Polybius,</hi> to thoſe who live in a Republick. What may farther be added concerning the Hiſtory of this Author, I leave to be perform'd, by the Elegant Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator of his Work.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE OF THE TRANSLATOR.</head>
                  <p>MY Attempt to render this Excellent Author into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> puts me under a neceſſity of making my Excuſe to the World for ingageing in ſo nice and difficult a Work; And I frankly, first, confeſs, <hi>That I had no Warrant from my Depth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof to make Oſtentation, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in indeed, he who moſt abounds, ever finds leaſt cauſe of boaſting.</hi> This I own to prevent the Criticks, who, for the most part, while they amuſe and buſie themſelves about the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Words, ſhew but little Inſight in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof their Authors treat; which is the ſolid and uſeful part of Knowledge. Nor was it a Deſire to be ſeen in Print, it being never my Purpoſe to appear in Publick. For who of but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Sence would take pleaſure to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a Crowd of Fools, who in theſe our Days ſo much peſter the Preſs? My Motive then, in a word, was principally to comply with the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:61906:21"/>of a Great Man, and a Friend, whoſe Commands to me while he liv'd were Sacred, as his Memory must be now he is remov'd from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. To this Gentleman interpreting now and then ſome Select Paſſages out of <hi>Polybius,</hi> to entertain his Retirement, he grew ſo far in love with our Author, and ſo charm'd with the Force and Perfection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline, that no Excuſe I could make of my Inſufficiency avail'd, but I must render him into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This Command, I ſay, which could not be decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excus'd, begat the Attempt, which, by new Importunity, is permitted to viſit the World; when he, for whoſe ſake it was done, has left it, to enjoy that Repoſe in a better, which his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (jealous of his Vertue) maliciouſly refus'd him. And he who would have gloried to Die in the Service of his Country, who was the best Friend and every way one of the best Men of the Age, had the mortification to be a Sacrifice to Slander, and the reſtleſs Perſecution of thoſe who thought, and perhaps juſtly, that they could not ſhine till he ſhou'd be extinguiſh'd. My diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then, to do right to my Author, being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by the Importunity of my Friend, I took aſſurance to think, that my Defects on the one hand might in ſome degree be ſupply'd by the long Acquaintance and Converſation I have had in thoſe Matters which are principally treated by <hi>Polybius:</hi> who himſelf and most others of that ſort, who have been interpreted to us by meer Scholars and Book-learned Men, have been ſo
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:61906:21"/>miſus'd, that it may be ſaid, They are rather Tradue'd than Tranſlated: And I dare appeal to the diſcernment of the knowing World, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the great Genius of one of the most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Men of the last Age, Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears like himſelf in his Tranſlation of <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides!</hi> And if he, who when he writes his own Thoughts and Matter, is ſo admirable both for Purity of Language, and Strength of Reaſon, does not there, for the most part, diſappoint the Expectation of the Reader? 'Tis no wonder then if <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers of ſo much a lower Form, as most are who ingage in theſe Works, ſo ſeldom ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, notwithſtanding their Knowledge in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Skill in Tongues, when in their own Mother-language, I will be hold to affirm, they will be often found at a loſs to conceive rightly of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So neceſſary it will be found to be a Man of the World; of Buſineſs, Science, and Converſation, who wou'd ingage with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of doing well in ſuch Enterprizes.

                  <p>I was ſaying how difficult I thought it was to Tranſlate a good Author well: there is no way more beaten and travell'd, yet none more hard to find; <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> have the Voice of the Learn'd, in favour of their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and other Advantages of Style and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in their Writings: But where, I ſay, do theſe Excellencies ſhine in their Interpreters, who I take for granted wanted not competent Furniture of Knowledge in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue? For my ſelf, I can own, without ſcruple, that I am not touch'd nor edify'd by what I there read; their Charms are not by their Spokeſmen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:61906:22"/>to my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. Let us, for trial, conſult an Example out of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and make choice of <hi>Pericles</hi>'s Funeral Oration, ſo much applauded by Learned Men; what I pray does it ſpeak in <hi>Engliſh?</hi> The Subſtance and Materials I confeſs are ſeen, but the Compoſition, the Style and Structure, are ſlight and Gothick: And, for my own particular, I can ingenuouſly ſay, that I have no Bowels, no Tears for thoſe poor Men; I neither hear their Groans, nor ſee their Merits, as they are render'd in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And this will always happen to Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who are but plain meer Scholars, and even to others who with over anctious ſcrupuloſity walk ſo timorouſly in the Track of their Authors, that they cannot hold pace with them; and think they do enough, if they but keep them in view, tho' at never ſo great a diſtance. For 'tis not Tranſcribing his Words, but Transfuſing his Mind, that does an Author juſtice; if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Genius do not in ſome degree every where appear, we do but ſlammer out his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo draw his Picture, that but for the Title, no body could know it. Yet I am in no doubt, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> cou'd have abundantly ſhown and diſplayed all the Beauties, and juſtly expreſs'd the Energy of the Style, and the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Perfections of that Oration; and given us another kind of Verſion of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> had not his fear of falling into the Hands of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Criticks withheld him. But while I ſtudy to conceive aright, and explain my Sence of the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:61906:23"/>Duty of a Tranſlator, I am at the ſame moment deeply conſcious of my own weak Performance; ſo much eaſier it is to think juſtly, than to do well; and under this Self-ſentence I trust I may find ſome ſhelter against Cenſure. I know, that to have done <hi>Polybius</hi> exact justice, I ought to have ſtudy'd him longer; I ſhou'd have been better acquainted with his Life and Manners, and as familiar with him, if poſſible, as his Friends <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius;</hi> for ſo I might in many places, obſcure in words, have penetrated his Meaning by my knowledge of the Man: But what ſhall I ſay? I have dealt him the fairest meaſure I was able, I have made him ſpeak the best <hi>Engliſh</hi> I cou'd, without hurting his Senſe, while I have neither ſetter'd my ſelf to his Words, nor been ty'd ſo much as to his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: But when I thought I knew his Mind, I utter'd it in the best manner I cou'd. Thus I have proceeded in the Narrative-part, and his Accounts of Matter of Fact; but where he Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizes, Inſtructs and Acts the Orator, which are the most difficult to be handl'd, I have there dealt more tenderly and ſhown the best care I was able to approach his manner. <hi>Polybius</hi> was, without all queſtion, a very great Man, he was Noble, and of the first Rank of his Country, a Souldier, a States-man and a Philoſopher, and withal of an excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; Poliſh'd and Cultivated by Buſineſs and eminent Truſts, and Temper'd and Balaſted by his own and his Country's Afflictions. So that it may be ſaid,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:61906:23"/>No Man ever ingag'd in a Work of this ſort better furniſh'd with Requiſites; and he ſeems to fill the Chair, when he treats diſtinctly on any of the above-nam'd Subjects: But when he talks of War, which is the Favourite, Subject and Darling of Hiſtory; How like a General and perfect Maſter in that Trade does he acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! How exact and painful is he in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Battles by Land and Sea, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every particular that may afford light to his Reader! How finely, fruitfully, juſtly, and morally does he Inſtruct and Reaſon on Events of Councils, Battles and all kind of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions! How does <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Craft and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and <hi>Flaminius</hi>'s Raſhneſs and Folly appear in his Account of the Battle of <hi>Thraſymene,</hi> inſomuch that from Readers we become Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of all thoſe Exploits! How faithful is he to the Character of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in their Naval Knowledge and Strength! And with what Frankneſs, Aſſurance and Impartiality does he ſhew the <hi>Romans</hi> Ignorance, and reprove their Raſhneſs, when he compares thoſe two People on the Subject of their Maritime Affairs and Adventures! All which we read with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and approve with eaſe. So that, in a word, he will be found throughout to preſerve his Character of a Grave, Able and Impartial Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He is cenſur'd I know ſomewhere, for his little Religion, which Aſperſion his own Words will best wipe off, where, in his Fifth Book, he ſo ſolemnly reprehends <hi>Philip,</hi> Son of <hi>Demetrius;</hi>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:61906:24"/>and the <hi>Etolians</hi> for their impious Razing of Temples, and caſting down of Statues, and the Altars of the Gods. But I ſhould intrench on the Province of a much abler <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker, ſhould I further proſecute this Subject; the Character of <hi>Polybius</hi> being, as I am told, undertaken by One, who of all others, is best able to do him Juſtice. Wherefore leaving my Author in ſo good Hands, I proceed to the Subject, and obſerve that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Matter, and the Period of Time wherein he Wrote, ſeem'd to conſpire to the Dignity and Perfection of the Work, which was a Body of General Hiſtory, conſiſting of Forty Books; of which Number, to the unſpeakable Loſs of the World, Five only entire have deſcended down to us: But it has happily chanc'd, that they are the Five Books from the beginning in their Order; tho' the two firſt not being of the Body of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and rather a Proem to that great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; the Reader will not be Surpriz'd, nor take Offence to ſee the Preface, as I may ſay, to what is now publiſh'd, ſwell ſo much out of all Proportion to the Book, when he ſhall conſider that properly Speaking, it is the Portico or Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece of a ſo much ſtatelier Edifice; and as it contains a Summary or Abſtract of the entire Work, ſo does it not a little confer to Inſtitution. The whole Work contain'd the Hiſtory of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> their Tranſactions and Adventures with the <hi>Carthaginians, Greeks,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Aſia, Aegypt, Spain,</hi> and all the most memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Occurrences of the World, during the ſpace
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:61906:24"/>of Three and Fifty Years, beginning with the ſecond Punick War, which commenc'd in tho third Year of the hundred and fortieth Olympiad, and of the World three thouſand ſeven hundred eighty ſeven, and ending with thoſe Affairs which gave a Period to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Which Space of time, as it contains the Bulk of all the great Actions, Conqueſts, and Succeſſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, ſo it ſeems to be the very Meridian of their Glory and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for they had now by their long practice in War and their converſation with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other poliſh'd Nations, reſin'd their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which before were courſe and ruſtick. They had ſcour'd off the Rust of their Old Iron Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſo Auſtere and Rigid, that it grew to an Idol, a <hi>Moloch;</hi> to which Generals ſacrific'd even their Sons: No Citizens Blood, in civil Diſſention, had yet ſlain'd their Concord: Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, 'tis true, had began to ceaſe to be a Vertue, and was not ſo venerable as when their Dictators went to Plough: But their Taſte of Riches ſeem'd rather an Effect of their Ambition and Military Glory to adom their Triumphs, and repleniſh their Treaſury with a Fund to enable them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their Deſign of Subduing the World. They had yet no leiſure for Luxury; and that eager Spirit of Conqueſt which ſpurr'd and inſpir'd them, had preſerv'd their Minds hitherto untainted with the Vices of Eaſe and a voluptuous Life. In a word, their good Diſcipline, which Induſtry, long Practice, and the Neceſſity and Danger of
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:61906:25"/>the State had taught them, while they were yet but weak, and under the apprehenſion of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rivals, became at length, when it had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them against Invaders, to inſpire them with the Spirit of Invaſion; and conducted them to the acquiſition of that ſtupendous Power and Dominion, which was the Subject of ſo many Triumphs, and compleated, in concluſion, their Subjection of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe. What their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was, has been the Argument of many Pens, and wou'd not ſuit with this Work to enlarge on: But what Diſcipline is, in the Abſtract, I may eſſay to deliver my Opinion in few words.</p>
                  <p>Good Diſcipline is the Subſtance and Sum-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of Military Science, and he who would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to the Command of Armies by Sea or Land, and is not himſelf duly Train'd, and a Maſter therein, and a Lover, Promoter, and Exacter of it in others, ſhall betray the Prince or State who Truſts him; and expoſe himſelf and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to manifold Perils and Diſaſters. The Principles of Diſcipline are partly collected and digeſted into a Body of ſtanding Rules and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; the Harvest of wiſe and long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the best Men, in the best Times; and partly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwritten and Traditional, infus'd by Practice, Converſation and diligent Application and Inquiry of thoſe who would be Proficients therein. In ſhort, 'tis an Art or Habit of prudential Fortitude, on the nicest and most perilous Adventures of Humane Life. Now the Fruit which is gather'd, is in the Practice of
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:61906:25"/>theſe Documents; and the hinge and center of Motion of this great Machine, on which it turns, is Obedience; which among the <hi>Romans</hi> was Sacred and Inviolable, as the Oracles of their Gods, the Breach whereof was more puniſhable when ſucceſsful, than otherwiſe. For though Fortune was among them a Deity, Diſcipline was more Worſhipp'd, and they would not allow her to juſtifie a raſh Action. Thus <hi>Papirius,</hi> the Dictator, was hardly won to ſpare young <hi>Fabius,</hi> his Maſter of the Horſe, for Fighting though ſucceſsfully in his abſence, against his Order; whoſe Life, with much Difficulty, was given to the Tears and Merits of his old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the Story of <hi>Titus Manlius,</hi> who condemn'd his brave Son to Death, is a cruel Inſtance. Diſcipline is the Art of doing the hardest Things, the eaſiest and nearest way; her prime Element is Honour: She teaches us to Dye without Fear, when we cannot Live without Reproach; ſhe abſolves the most unfortunate Actions where ſhe Conducts; ſhe ſhews us how to be Savers when we cannot Win, and loſes many a Battle without loſs of Fame; ſhe rallies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unites broken Troops, and has often ſnatch'd the Lawrel from the Brow of Victory her ſelf; ſhe is the brave Man's Motto, and the Coward's Shield. The one ſhe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rges, while ſhe Animates the other; ſhe ſuſtains hunger-ſtarv'd Armies, and makes them Obey, March, Fight and Vanquiſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Clothes on their Backs, Meat in their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or Fleſh on their Bones. To ſuffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:61906:26"/>Hunger, Cold, and want of every needful Thing, is a laſie, feminine, and, as I may ſay, a vagabond Vertue: but to act bravely, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey ſilently, and exactly, and to do worthily in every thing under ſuch Straights and Tryals, belongs only to thoſe whoſe Minds and Manners are imbu'd with this Soveraign Vertue of good Diſcipline. But that we may not Spin this Thread too fine, let us contract our Speculation, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſhort, That Diſcipline is the Soul of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Action; 'tis the Founder and Preſerver of Kingdoms; ſhe leads Fortune her ſelf in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and by her (under Providence) Princes Reign, and their Thrones are Eſtabliſh'd. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder her Banners did the <hi>Romans</hi> ſubdue the World, and vanquiſh in Battel more than double their number of Enemies, equal, if not ſuperiour to them, in Strength and natural Courage; and the Glory of that great State ebb'd and ſlow'd with their Diſcipline, which, as it is the Parent of Succeſs, ſo is it the Child of mighty Vertue and Induſtry: Vice and Luxury (which are her mortal Foes) have no Footing where ſhe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns; they are ſo incompatible, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the one, is ever the Advancement of the other; no State, but by Miracle, can ſink under her Conduct, or be ſafe where ſhe is not cheriſh'd. What has made our Neighbouring Prince ſo Formidable, but their excellent Form, and exact Obſervance of the Precepts of good Diſcipline, where Obedience, like the Key-ſtone in the Arch, binds and ſuſtains the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick?
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:61906:26"/>And if diſcerning Eyes would look near, and penetrate the ground and neceſſity of this Duty, in our Caſe, they would diſcover Reaſons that are not viſible to vulgar Eyes. Wherefore I will take leave of the Gentlemen of the Long-Robe, to allow this kind of Obedience, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all kinds of Submiſſion, or Reſignation whatſoever. The Ancients have painted Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion only bald behind, but here we may add Wings too; For what is more ſleeting and fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when ſhe's often hardly ſeen, but ſhe's past? Crowns, Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and every thing Sacred and Valuable among Men, do, in our Caſe, often hang on a ſingle Thread of a Moment; which by one bare Act of Diſatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Diſobedience to Orders, may be lost: And Hiſtory is thick ſet with Inſtances, (which I may here be excus'd from exemplifying) where what I ſay is abundantly prov'd. The Schools may amuſe and intangle us with their Cobweb-learning, their Terms and Subtilties; but let them ſhow me in ſound Wiſdom and ſafe Morals any Tranſgreſſion of Obedience to whatſoever Humane Precept, that can bring a heavier Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Mankind, where no Sacrifice, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance can Attone, or Power Abſolve. We ſhall not then (I trust) be thought in the wrong, in thus dignifying this Vertue of Obedience in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Conduct.</p>

                     <hi>I was almoſt ingag'd unawares to extend my Contemplation on this noble Theme, which, by applying it to Ourſelves, with
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:61906:27"/>reſpect eſpecially to Our Naval Diſcipline, might perhaps have prov'd no Diſſervice to my Country. But as we never viſit Perſons of Quality by the bye, but obtain an Hour to perform our Reſpects with Decency: So I have concluded I ought to treat that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which as it wou'd ſwell beyond the due Bounds of a Preface; ſo it deſerves to be handl'd with more Regard, than cou'd be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd towards it in this Place.</hi>

                     <p>IF other Authors, who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, had omitted to ſpeak in the Praiſe of Hiſtory; it might perhaps have left an Engagement on us, to recommend principally, that ſort of Study to the World, in as much as there is no Means or Method more ſhort, or leſs difficult, whereby to cultivate the Mind, than the knowledge of Times paſt. But in regard it hath been the Buſineſs of many Writers, to ſhew, that the Fruit we gather from Hiſtory, is the moſt mature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, and yields the propereſt Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to form the Underſtanding for Publick
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61906:28"/>Uſes; and beſt arms and prepares us, againſt the ſhocks of adverſe Fortune, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and reflection on other Mens Croſſes and Calamities; our ſilence therefore on that Subject, will be the more pardonable, while the beſt we ſhould be able ſay, would be no other than what ſo many excellent Wits have ſaid before us; and when we have done all, our Subject needs it not: For, in ſhort, the Account of thoſe ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Events, which we have undertaken to Publiſh, will ſuffice for its own Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and beſpeak the Attention of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to what ſhall be related. For who is ſo ſtupid and incurious, that would not be glad to learn, by what wonderful means and force of Conduct, the People of <hi>Rome</hi> could within the ſpace of three and fifty Years, be able to compaſs the Conqueſt and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the greateſt Part of the known World? A Felicity which never yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to any People, at leaſt it hath not any parallet in Hiſtory. And indeed what Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, how magnificent and entertaining ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to the moſt Curious; or what Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, tho' never ſo profitable to the moſt Studious, hath at any time been the Subject of our Contemplation, that ought not to give place and yield the Preference both in Pleaſure and Inſtruction to the Knowledge of this Tranſcendent Story?</p>
                     <p>Nor will it be difficult to Exemplifie the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61906:28"/>Grandure and Singularity of the Work we have undertaken, by drawing Parallels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the moſt Flouriſhing States that have been recorded in Story. And thoſe, which in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are moſt worthy to be conſider'd, are namely theſe that follow: Firſt, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire; which was once Great and Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, yet ſo it happen'd, that they never attempted to extend their Conqueſts beyond the bounds of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but they not only endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd the loſs of their Armies, but hazarded the State it ſelf. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſtrove long for the Dominion of <hi>Greece,</hi> and at length obtain'd it; but ſcarce held it Twelve Years in peaceable Poſſeſſion. The <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> acquir'd a good ſhare of Territory in <hi>Europe,</hi> extending from the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea to the <hi>Danube;</hi> but who will not confeſs, that this was but a ſmall Tract, compar'd with that vaſt Continent? Afterwards indeed, their Conqueſts and Dominion ſpread into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy compos'd a part of their Empire. But what People is there, how powerful and enterprizing ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of whom, it may not with Truth be ſaid, That a very great part of this our World hath eſcap'd their Power and Ambition. In a word, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> never dream'd of attempting either <hi>Sicily</hi> or <hi>Sardinia,</hi> or of carrying their Arms into <hi>Africk;</hi> nor had they the leaſt notice of many fierce and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61906:29"/>mighty Nations inhabiting the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> While of the <hi>Romans</hi> it will with Juſtice be granted, that they have not vanquiſh'd by parcels, here and there a Kingdom; but ſubdu'd and extended their Empire over almoſt the known World, and have exalted and eſtabliſh'd the Glory of their Dominion, to that degree of Power and Perfection, that if the preſent Age can but wiſely ſupport the Exceſs of their Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no future Times ſhall be able to produce the like.</p>
                     <p>The Sequel of this extraordinary Story, will prove with Evidence enough what we but now obſerv'd; namely, That of all Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, That of Hiſtory yields the moſt ſolid and profitable Fruit, when it makes profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of recounting Occurrences of paſt Ages with Candor and Fidelity. Ours with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chronology, ſhall take beginning from the one hundred and fortieth Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad: The Subject Matter ſhall be; Firſt, with reſpect to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Confederate War which <hi>Phillip,</hi> the Son of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and Father of <hi>Perſius,</hi> did in Conjunction with the <hi>Achaians,</hi> wage againſt thoſe of <hi>Aetolia.</hi> Touching the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> we ſhall treat of the War in <hi>Syria,</hi> betwixt <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy Philopater:</hi> As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Aſrick,</hi> we ſhall begin with the Hiſtory of the War between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> commonly call'd the War
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61906:29"/>of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> In brief, our Hiſtory ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence where <hi>Aratus</hi> the <hi>Sycionian</hi> gives a Period to his. For, in truth, the State in general of things to thoſe Days, were (as one may ſay) ſcatter'd and confus'd, and without any common Relation; the Motives to their great Enterpriſes were divers, and alſo their Ends; and Times, and Places, were equally dark and diſtant. But here we have a Foundation and Body of Hiſtory for our Guide; the Affairs of <hi>Italy, Greece, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> were now as it were incorporate, and conſpiring to one and the ſame great End. And therefore I reſolv'd, and thought it my beſt Method, here to begin what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to write.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> proving Superior to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> in the War we mention'd, found Aſſurance to believe, that they had now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd far towards the Dominion of the World; and took reſolution thence to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their good Fortune, and form'd thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their firſt Project, for tranſporting their Arms into <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Aſia.</hi> Were we not for the moſt part in the dark, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general State and Circumſtances of thoſe People, who from time to time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Soveraignty, we might perhaps ſpare the Pains we ſhall take, to enquire and ſhew, by what Means and Motives, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were incited to engage in ſo vaſt an Enterpriſe. But in regard the World for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61906:30"/>the moſt part is to learn by what ſtock of Strength and Military Conduct, the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> ſtrove with their happier Rivals the <hi>Romans,</hi> and what Battels it coſt to decide the Controverſie; we have therefore thought it neceſſary, to conceive and digeſt our two firſt Books, into a form of Preface to the main Work; fearing leſt if we ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unawares, into the Narrative of ſuch wonderful Adventures as will occur; we ſhould with Aſtoniſhment look back on the mighty Progreſs, and be to ſeek for thoſe Cauſes and Motives, that inſpir'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to Embark in ſo extraordinary a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as the Acquiſition of the Univerſal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. At leaſt it may ſuffice, to initiate the Reader, and inſtruct him in the feaſibleneſs of the Enterpriſe, and ſhew, that their Power was not ſhort of their Ambition, to attempt, and, in effect, to compaſs what they had projected. For what will be found ſingular and extraordinary in this Work, and thoſe unparalell'd Examples of Events in this our Age, is, that Fortune leaning, and as it were with a ſtrong Biaſs, bending all her Power one way, and Collecting and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating (as one may ſay) the Forces of the Univerſe, for the Accompliſhment of one vaſt Deſign: We ſhall therefore labour to ſhew, and in one Draught, as in a Picture, gratifie the Reader with a Proſpect of thoſe Means and Steps, by which ſhe conducted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61906:30"/>her Counſels to bring this mighty Work to paſs. And this indeed was what principally incited me to adventure on this Work, joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Reflection, That no Author in theſe our Days, hath yet engag'd in the like Enterpriſe, of Compiling and Publiſhing a General Hiſtory; which under leſs Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement I ſhould hardly have been drawn to undertake. But having obſerv'd, that albeit there are plenty of Writers, who have employ'd their Pens in Recording particular Wars, and ſome certain contemporary Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions and Occurrences; yet there is not One (that I remember) who hath given us any Light into the Notions of General Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor have thoſe who have written, ſhewn any Care in adjuſting the Chronology of the Affairs they have handled; nor the Cauſes and Reaſons leading to any Revolution; nor the Progreſs and Management, nor the Manner of the Event of Things. I have then on theſe Reflections concluded it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and that it would not be an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preſent, to delineate and expoſe to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick View this moſt Magnificent, and of all others the moſt Inſtructive Inſtance of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune's Power; who, tho' we have daily and numerous Accounts of her extraordinary Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and behold her conſtantly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Proofs of her Abilities, we muſt nevertheleſs conclude, without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that ſhe hath given ſuch Evidences
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61906:31"/>of her Strength in our Days, as ſurpaſſes all Example.</p>
                     <p>Nor would it be eaſie to obtain a right Knowledge of ſo many marvelous Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by any help that may be derived from the Study of particular Hiſtory, any more than one can be enabled to give a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Structure and Figure of the wide Univerſe, by having conſulted the Map, or viſited ſome few Towns or Provinces thereof. And we may fitly compare ſuch as make that wrong Judgment, to thoſe, who, beholding the diſpers'd and ſingle Members of ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which while it had Life and Motion, had Beauty and other Excellencies; would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to determine and diſtinguiſh of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Perfections wherewith it was Adorn'd, when Living; while, in Truth, were it poſſible to give a perfect Image of them, by uniting the ſcatter'd Parts, reſtoring the Form, and giving it Spirit and Motion, he would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to confeſs that all his Conjectures had been a Dream: And yet we maintain not, but that a ſort of Judgment may be made of the whole, by conſulting only the Parts, but the Certitude and entire Verity of Things cannot be ſo acquir'd. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we conceive, that the bare Study of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and limited Occurences, can but little avail towards the Improvement of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in General Hiſtory; which cannot be attain'd, but by ſorting (as I may ſay) and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61906:31"/>comparing Counſels and Events, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of Things we ſhall Obſerve, and the Difference we ſhall Remark; and thus we approach the Sanctuary, and penetrate the very Boſom of Hiſtory, and the Fruit we gather will both profit and pleaſe. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, The firſt Naval Expedition the <hi>Romans</hi> ventur'd on, beyond the Bounds of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhall be the beginning, and as it were the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of this our firſt Book; wherein the Story is continued, where <hi>Timaeus</hi> the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ends, which fell out in the Hundred and Twenty Ninth Olympiad.</p>
                     <p>It behoves us then to inſtruct the Reader, firſt, in the Time when, and the Means and Manner how the <hi>Romans</hi> compos'd their Affairs in <hi>Italy;</hi> and then to obſerve what their Motives were to attempt croſſing the Seas into <hi>Sicily,</hi> for that was their firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Theſe things, I ſay, it will be neceſſary firſt to explain, to the end we may avoid all danger of Obſcurity in the purſuit of our Hiſtory, and preſerve the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence and Gradation of Cauſes and Things unbroken: It is likewiſe further neceſſary, that we ſhould take our beginning from ſome certain and limited Period of Time, known and remarkable to all. And this will be found ſo very uſeful, that Matters will almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themſelves, when there ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to look back, to renew in the Mind the Notices of what is paſt. For where Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61906:32"/>are not founded on plain and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Teſtimony, we read without Faith, and determine of nothing; whereas, when the Underſtanding is once ſet right, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on the Evidence of clear and unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd Grounds, we Study and Digeſt what we Read, with Pleaſure and Aſſurance, and yield a ready Conſent to the Candour and Authority of the Writer.</p>

And after they had well-nigh ſubdu'd the <hi>Latins,</hi> partly by their Courage, and partly by the Addreſs they had acquir'd by their long Exerciſe in Arms, they advanc'd againſt the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61906:32"/>had to do, almoſt at the ſame time, with the <hi>Gauls;</hi> and then warr'd on the <hi>Samnites,</hi> who were the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the <hi>Latins.</hi> Soon after, and about a Year before the <hi>Gauls</hi> invaded <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Remainder of that People who had rifled <hi>Delphos,</hi> and were almoſt all cut off, paſs'd into <hi>Aſia; Pyrrhus,</hi> King of the <hi>Epirots,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> invited thither by the <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> who began to apprehend the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their having violated the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſadors.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61906:33"/>
                        <hi>Rhegium,</hi> then poſſeſſed by certain of their own mutinous Subjects. One and the ſame Adventure befel two principal Places, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the Streight of that Sea, namely, <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium</hi> and <hi>Meſſina.</hi> In ſhort, ſome time before thoſe things happen'd, which we have been relating, a Party of <hi>Campanian</hi> Mercenaries, who had ſerv'd under <hi>Agathocles</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> tempted with the Beauty and Riches of <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,</hi> form'd a Conſpiracy to ſurpriſe it, and keep the poſſeſſion; which they did by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, being receiv'd into the Town, and entertain'd as Friends. When they became Maſters of the place, ſome of the Inhabitants they expell'd, and others they murther'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their own uſe the Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of that unfortunate People, as they chanc'd to fall into their hands during the diſpute: Thus having without much hazard or trouble obtain'd a remarkable Victory, and become poſſeſs'd of an opulent City, they divided the Riches and Territory amongſt themſelves. This Action gave Example to another of the like barbarous Treachery. During <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s Devaſtations in <hi>Italy,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> apprehenſive of the danger of this new and formidable Enemy; and being on the other hand in dread of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were in thoſe days Maſters of the Sea, beſought the <hi>Romans</hi> to lend them Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and furniſh them with a Garriſon: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they ſupply'd them with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61906:33"/>Men, giving the Command to one <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> a <hi>Campanian,</hi> who for ſome time kept good Garriſon, and demean'd themſelves as they ought: But at length, in Imitation of the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> who ſupply'd them with Forces to effect their Treachery, they violated their Faith by the like villainous Act, tempted thereunto by the commodious Situation of the Place, and the Wealth of the Inhabitants; of whom, having poſſeſs'd the Town, ſome they expell'd, and ſome they cut off, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Treachery of that People exactly. The <hi>Romans</hi> had a juſt Sence of this wicked Act; but having at that time too much Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on their hands, by the Wars we but now related, were not in a Condition to expreſs their Indignation in the Puniſhment of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; but as ſoon as their Affairs permitted, they march'd againſt <hi>Rhegium,</hi> where they ſtraitly beſieg'd the Traitors, and in the end ſubdu'd them, who fought obſtinately, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſperate of Pardon, not above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them being taken alive; who being ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> were by the Command of the Praetor, dragg'd to the common place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, where, as the manner is, they were firſt ſcourg'd with Rods, and then beheaded. The <hi>Romans,</hi> over and above the Equity, were not without Foreſight, that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Act wou'd be to conciliate in their Neighbours, the Opinion of their Juſtice and Honour, which had been much ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61906:34"/>miſhed by this piece of Treachery; ſo the <hi>Rhegians</hi> were forthwith reſtor'd to their Town and their Poſſeſſions.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Mamertines</hi> (for that Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe <hi>Campanians</hi> aſſum'd) who had ſo wrongfully poſſeſs'd <hi>Meſſina,</hi> they enjoy'd, without any Moleſtation, both the Town and Territory, ſo long as they cou'd derive Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from the <hi>Romans</hi> their Friends in <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> and liv'd not only ſecure, and fearleſs of any danger, but were often the Aggreſſors on their Neighbours the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and gave them work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defend the adjacent Country; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many Towns and Villages under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution. But they were no ſooner depriv'd of the Aids of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> which now could not defend itſelf, when the face of their Fortune chang'd; being attack'd by the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> and driven within their own Walls; that People having declar'd War againſt them for Reaſons we ſhall briefly deliver.</p>
                     <p>Sometime before this, while the Army of the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> encamped near <hi>Mergania,</hi> there happened a Diſſention between the Souldiers and Citizens of <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> the Souldiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made choice of new Leaders, namely, <hi>Artemidorus</hi> and <hi>Hieron,</hi> who was afterwards King of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> he was then indeed but young, howbeit Nature had given him all the good Qualities to be wiſh'd in a Prince. He was no ſooner advanc'd to this Power,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61906:34"/>but by the ſecret Practices and Addreſs of ſome of his Friends, he got poſſeſſion of the City, where he ſoon ſuppreſs'd thoſe of the contrary Faction; but proceeding in all things with ſo much Gentleneſs and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that tho' the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Election made by the Army, he was nevertheleſs received as Praetor, without the leaſt Conteſt. From the very beginning, by the manner of his Adminiſtration of that Authority, it plainly appear'd to thoſe who could beſt diſcern, that he was Born to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet greater than the Praetorſhip. For having rightly inform'd himſelf of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Manners of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> that they were Seditious, and no ſooner in Arms, but they fell into Factious and Mutinous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; and farther obſerving, that <hi>Leptines,</hi> one of the prime Citizens, Superiour to the reſt both in Credit and Intereſt, and in great Reputation with the People for his Juſtice and Probity, would be very uſeful to him; with him he made an Alliance, by taking his Daughter to Wife, and propoſing to lodge the Authority in the City with him, during his Expeditions with the Army abroad. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compaſs'd theſe things, and obſerving the old Mercenary Souldiers to have loſt their Diſcipline, to be quite ſpoil'd with Idleneſs and Debauchery, and to be over and above not very well affected to him, but were ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying and meditating ſome new Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61906:35"/>he therefore forms a pretence of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were poſſeſs'd of <hi>Meſſina;</hi> and having march'd out his Forces, he Incamp'd near <hi>Centuripa,</hi> in ſight of the Enemy, where, drawing up to ingage them, not far from the River <hi>Cyamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoros,</hi> he ſo ordered his Battel, that keeping his own Horſe and Foot near himſelf, with ſhew of attacking the Enemy elſewhere, he by that means deſignedly expos'd the <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> to the entire ſhock of the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> where they were all cut off; and while the Enemy were buſied in the Execution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his own People in ſafety to <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> By this Artifice he puniſh'd his <hi>Mercenaries,</hi> and got rid of the diſorderly and ſeditious part of his Army. In brief, having form'd an Army to his own Mind, he govern'd and preſerv'd his Authority in great Peace and Security; and obſerving the Enemy to be grown Inrolent by their late Succeſs, and that they made Inroads, and ſpoil'd the neighbouring Country, he march'd out of the City with his new Army, which he had now well Diſciplin'd, and meeting them in the Plains of <hi>Mylaeus,</hi> near the River <hi>Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> he obtain'd an entire Victory, routing their Army, and taking their principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers Priſoners: By which Succeſs they were ſo humbled, that they loſt all Courage for the future. Having perform'd theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he return'd with his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61906:35"/>Army to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where he was proclaim'd King by the Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> they being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of their wonted Succours from <hi>Rhegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and their own ſtrength being greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd by their late loſſes, one Party ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and deliver'd the Citadel into their Hands; another ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the <hi>Romans,</hi> praying their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and offering them the poſſeſſion of the City, imploring their Protection on the account of their Alliance and common Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The <hi>Romans</hi> were long debating what to determine herein, nor indeed could they honeſtly reſolve to aſſiſt them, it being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent how great a blemiſh it would be to their Honour, who, while they animadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Treachery of their own Citizens at <hi>Rhegium,</hi> ſhould be found abetting and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> eminently guilty of the like Crime. But they ſaw too, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had not only ſubdu'd <hi>Africa,</hi> but had made themſelves Maſters of many places in <hi>Spain;</hi> and that <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and all the adjacent Iſlands on the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> were already in their poſſeſſion; theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections were weigh'd with apprehenſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for the <hi>Romans</hi> already look'd on the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Neighbourhood with an Eye of Jealouſie, being, as it were, now ſurrounded by them; and knowing that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns on <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf; they foreſaw how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61906:36"/>they would grow by the Acceſſion of all <hi>Sicily</hi> to their State; and perceiv'd too, that this Iſland, unleſs they interpos'd to prevent it, by aſſiſting the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> would certainly fall into their Hands: For <hi>Meſſina</hi> would ſoon be theirs, and <hi>Syracuſe</hi> would not then be long able to withſtand them, the Territory of which two places contain'd a principal part of the Iſland. All this they clearly underſtood, and knew it would not be fafe for them to abandon thoſe of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and permit the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to be Maſters of a Poſt, that might prove as it were a Bridge to conduct them into <hi>Italy.</hi> Theſe Points were long and ſolemnly debated, and yet the Senate could not be drawn to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine without mighty difficulty, foreſeeing that the Reproach in aſſiſting the <hi>Mamertines</hi> would be greater than the Benefit. But the People, who had been greatly impoveriſh'd by their late Wars, and each Man propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf ſome way or other to repair his own particular damage, decreed to carry on the Enterpriſe; and the rather, for that thoſe who were to have Command of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, manifeſted how profitable an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking it wou'd be both for the State in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and each Man in particular. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree therefore paſs'd, and was confirm'd by an Ordinance of the People; and <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> one of the Conſuls, was ordered to conduct an Army forthwith into <hi>Sicily,</hi> to the Relief of <hi>Meſſina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61906:36"/>
                     <p>To him the <hi>Mamertines</hi> deliver'd up the City, after, either by Art or Force, they had got rid of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Officer who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Citadel: But the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſuſpecting Treachery or Cowardiſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſaid Governour to be Crucified. At the ſame time they directed their Fleet to make towards <hi>Pelorus,</hi> and encamp'd with their Land-Army near a Town called <hi>Senes,</hi> and beſieg'd <hi>Meſſina</hi> with all their Forces. <hi>Hieron</hi> conceiving he ſaw now a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of exterminating the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> out of <hi>Sicily;</hi> enters into a Confederacy with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and forthwith marches with an Army from <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> towards <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and encamp'd along the Mountain <hi>Chalcidicus,</hi> to cut off all Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the beſieg'd on that ſide. But <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> with unſpeakable Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, paſſing the <hi>Streight</hi> by Night, got at length into <hi>Meſſina.</hi> Howbeit, perceiving the Beſiegers reſolute, and the Town ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſs'd on both ſides, and the Army ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior by Sea and Land, and apprehending both Danger and Diſhonour in the Enterpriſe, he diſpatch'd Ambaſſadours to the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Hieron,</hi> to treat about an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and obtain Peace for the <hi>Mamertines.</hi> But the Negotiation not taking effect, and finding there was now no Remedy but Fighting; he reſolv'd firſt to attack the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſians;</hi> Accordingly he march'd out againſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61906:37"/>
                        <hi>Hieron,</hi> who oppos'd him with great Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gallantry, but after a long and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp Conflict the <hi>Romans</hi> had the day; beating and purſuing the Enemy into their Camp; and ſo <hi>Appius</hi> return'd Victorious into <hi>Meſſina,</hi> loaded with the Spoils of the Enemy: And <hi>Hieron,</hi> who perceiv'd he had made a wrong Judgment touching the Iſſue of the War, march'd away immediately towards <hi>Syracuſe. Claudius</hi> receiving next Morning Intelligence of his Retreat, and being now full of aſſurance by his late Succeſs, reſolv'd to loſe no time, but forthwith to Attack like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Purſuant to which Reſolution, he order'd his Army to take their repaſt betimes, and to be under their Arms earlier than ordinary; and ſallying out by break of Day, he ſurpriz'd the Enemy, and routed them with great Slaughter; thoſe who eſcap'd being broken and ſcatter'd, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves in the Neighbouring Towns. Having obtain'd theſe Victories, and rais'd the Siege from before <hi>Meſſina,</hi> he began now to make Inroads here and there upon the Neighbouring Country, and proceeded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impediment to plunder as far as the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> and their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, whither at length-he march'd with his Army, and ſate down before <hi>Syracuſa.</hi> Thus have I related the Motives, and given the Hiſtory of the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt Expidition out of <hi>Italy.</hi> And for as much as we have judg'd

Tho' we have look'd yet a little farther back, the better to open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Reaſons of Things, to the end there may not remain the leaſt doubt. For in my Judgment, whoſoever would attain a right Knowledge of the preſent Greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, ſhould firſt be inform'd, when, and how Fortune began to Eſpouſe their Cauſe, for they had once loſt their Country; and farther, to be well inſtructed in the Means by which, and the time when, they had intirely reduc'd <hi>Italy</hi> under their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they began to form Deſigns of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Conqueſts. It will not therefore be thought ſtrange, if when we are to Treat of Great States and Mighty People, we ſhould labour to unfold the remoteſt Accounts of Antiquity, and draw our Supplies from as near the Spring-head as may be, which is the courſe we have taken, that we might be ſure to build on ſound and unſhaken Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſo that whatſoever People ſhall be the Subject of our Story, we ſhall endeavour to ſhew how, and when they began, and the Steps that conducted them to that degree of Power and Greatneſs, wherein we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them. And this is the Method we have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61906:38"/>been already purſuing, touching the Affairs of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But we will forbear farther Digreſſions, and proceed to our Hiſtory, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have lightly touch'd on ſome Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Matters; and what falls in order princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be noted, is the Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> during their Contention about <hi>Sicily;</hi> next will be the War in <hi>Africk:</hi> To which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd the War the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> wag'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> mannag'd firſt by <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him by <hi>Aſdrubal;</hi> about which time, the <hi>Romans</hi> invaded <hi>Illiria,</hi> and other remote Countries of <hi>Europe;</hi> then ſhall be handled the War they made on the <hi>Gauls</hi> inhabiting <hi>Italy,</hi> and in courſe, we ſhall mention that in <hi>Greece,</hi> call'd the <hi>Cleomenick</hi> War, which gives a period to our Second Book: Of theſe in order, with ſome neceſſary Remarks for better light into our Hiſtory; for we have not conceived it neceſſary, or in any manner profitable, to be over particular in thoſe things, it not being our purpoſe to write their Hiſtory, but ſo to touch them, as may ſuffice the better to guide the Reader into what we purpoſe to relate. In a word, it will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceiv'd by the Thread of our Diſcourſe, how neceſſary it was to make ſome recital of what others have ſaid before, ſo as to let in the Mind of the inquiſitive, by an eaſier paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to ſubſequent Occurrences: But above all, it behoves us to be punctual in ſetting
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61906:38"/>down the Revolutions in <hi>Sicily,</hi> during the War there, between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> than which for duration, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Example of the like in Hiſtory, nor of the Proviſions that were made to Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, nor for the Greatneſs of Action, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and hazard of Enterpriſes, number of Battels, and extraordinary Adventures. For in ſhort, thoſe two States had liv'd hitherto under an exact obſervance of their Laws, their Diicipline was pure and unſhaken, their Wealth not burthenſome, and their Strength equal. Whoſoever therefore ſhall carefully conſider the Form and Power of thoſe two States reſpectively, will be better able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Matter, whereby to make a juſter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon by this War only, than by any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Tranſactions whatſoever between them.</p>
                     <p>And now we have but one weighty Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to ſtay the Courſe of our Hiſtory, which is, that <hi>Philinus</hi> and <hi>Fabius,</hi> the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, who have the repute of excelling all others, in their Exactneſs and Fidelity in delivering this Story, have not nevertheleſs been ſo juſt in their Relations as became them. And yet when I conſider their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Life, I cannot well tell-how to charge them with deſign'd Falſhood. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inclin'd to think it hath happen'd to them, as it often does to Lovers, <hi>Philinus</hi>'s Affection for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> hath brib'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61906:39"/>his Belief in favour of their great Conduct, Wiſdom and Generoſity in all their Actions and Deliberations, and perverted his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the other hand, touching the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> As to <hi>Fabius,</hi> he acts the ſame part for his Country-men, nor would it be blam'd in the other Deportments of his Private Life, it being but juſt, that a Man of Honour ſhould bear Affection towards his Country and his Friends, and that he ſhew Averſion to their Enemies, and Love to their Friends, But when once a Man hath taken upon him the Character of an Hiſtorian, his Affections are no more his own, and he is to diveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of every Paſſion. For how often falls it out to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Duty of a Writer, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the Merits of an Enemy, and blame the Conduct of a Friend, when their Faults and Follies ſo require. For as a Horſe that is become blind, is render'd almoſt uſeleſs, ſo Hiſtory, if Truth be once wanting, ceaſeth to be of any uſe or inſtruction. We are therefore to make no difficulty to detect the Errors of a Friend, and to do right to the Vertues of an Enemy. Nor muſt we ſcruple ſometimes to blame thoſe, who but now had as juſt a Title to our Applauſe: It being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that ſuch, who have the Authority and Adminiſtration of Publick Affairs, ſhould not ſometimes miſcarry, or that thoſe who often err, ſhould not be now and then in the right. We are not therefore to weigh the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61906:39"/>Rank or Fortune of thoſe who are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but to be careful that our Writings ſpeak the Truth of their Actions. And that this is a juſt Obſervation, will appear by what follows: <hi>Philinus,</hi> in the beginning of his Second Book, reports, that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> and <hi>Syracuſians</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Meſſina;</hi> and that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who croſs'd the Sea to their Aſſiſtance, made a Sally out of the Town, but were repulſed with great Slaughter of their People: That ſoon after they made a ſecond Sally upon the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when they were not only beaten and forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but loſt the greateſt part of their Army, taken Priſoners by the Enemy. He likewiſe tells us, That after this, <hi>Hieron</hi> was ſeiz'd with a panick fear, and ſo violent an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger, that he deſerted his Camp by Night, and march'd away to <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> not only ſetting fire on his Tents, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his Garriſons from all ſuch places as he held in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertines.</hi> That the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in like manner quitted their Camp, ſoon after this Defeat of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and diſperſing, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themſelves in the Towns round about, without attempting to take the Field, or daring ſo much as to defend whatſoever they had without their Works; and that this Conſternation ſeizing the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, diſheartned their Officers from giving Battel to the <hi>Romans.</hi> That the <hi>Romans</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61906:40"/>keeping in their Rear, did not only ſpoil and pillage the Country round about, but laid Siege even to <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> Theſe, in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are Abſurdities too groſs to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd. For what is more inconſiſtent, than to make thoſe, who but now beſieg'd <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,</hi> and were in all things victorious, to fly without any apparent cauſe, and to conſent to be themſelves beſieg'd. And as to the other Party, which he tells us, was beſieg'd and vanquiſh'd, he gives them the Lawrel, makes them Maſters of the Field, purſuing the Enemy, and leads them at length to the Siege of <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> What Conſiſtency now can be found in this Relation? We muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine therefore, that what he firſt delivers is falſe, or the ſequel cannot be true. But the latter is true, for the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Syracuſians</hi> were beaten and forc'd within their Works, and <hi>Syracuſe</hi> and <hi>Echetla</hi> were both at one and the ſame time beſieg'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Philinus</hi> confeſſeth, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being a Town on their Frontiers. We cannot help concluding then, that this his firſt Account was untrue, and the Defeat he mentions a Falſhood of his own coining; ſince he allows the <hi>Romans</hi> to have remain'd ſuperiour to the Enemy in thoſe Encounters before <hi>Meſſina.</hi> But, in ſhort, we ſhall find both <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Philinus</hi> to be the ſame Men throughout, as we ſhall have occaſion to obſerve in the purſuit of our Story; to which,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61906:40"/>after this Digreſſion, let us now return, and with the beſt Connexion we can, labour briefly and truly to relate the Adventures and Iſſue of this War.</p>
                     <p>Upon the News, at <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Succeſs of <hi>Appius</hi> and the Legions in <hi>Sicily, M. Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi> and <hi>M. Valerius</hi> being choſen Conſuls, it was decreed, they ſhould both go with all the Legions to proſecute that War. The <hi>Romans,</hi> over and above the Supplies drawn from their Allies, had at that time a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Force of Four Legions, out of which they form'd their yearly Levies, each Legion conſiſting of Four Thouſand Foot, and Three Hundred Horſe. Upon the arrival of the Conſuls, moſt of the Towns and Places that had ſubmitted to the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> and <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> gave themſelves up to the <hi>Romans;</hi> inſomuch, that <hi>Hieron</hi> obſerving the Terror that was ſpread through the whole Iſland, on the one hand; and on the other, the Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Number of the Legionaries, began to diſcern, that the Deſigns and Hopes of the <hi>Romans</hi> were founded on better Meaſures than thoſe of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> which, after he had maturely weigh'd, he determin'd to endeavour to be reconcil'd to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Accordingly he diſpatch'd Embaſſadors to treat with the Conſuls about an Alliance, who without difficulty embrac'd the Overture; to which they were the more willingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd, on account of the great difficulty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61906:41"/>they were under with their Convoys; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtly apprehenſive, leſt the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who were Maſters at Sea, would be able totally to debar them of all Supplies of Proviſion; and this Jealouſie was ſo much the more reaſonable, by how much their Troops, the laſt Year, were driven to great Straits.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> then promiſing themſelves good Fruit of this Alliance, readily yielded, and frankly embrac'd a Friendſhip with <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> on condition that all the <hi>Roman</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſhould be releas'd without Ranſom, and that the King ſhould pay them down a Hundred Talents in Silver, on which Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ſhould be held as Friends and Confederates of the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus <hi>Hieron,</hi> ſecur'd by this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, continu'd ever after a firm and profitable Friend to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and paſs'd the reſt of his Days in a peaceful enjoyment of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of that Kingdom, in very great eſteem among the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and, in a word, according to my Opinion, was one of the moſt Eminent and Illuſtrious Princes that had ever held that Scepter, and few will be found to have reap'd a larger ſhare of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity acquir'd by his own Vertue; whether we conſider him in his Domeſtick or Publick Affairs.</p>
                     <p>This Treaty being ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd by an Ordinance of the People, it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61906:41"/>was now thought adviſable to abate of the Number of their Troops in that Service, and to ſend only two Legions; making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that by this Alliance they ſhould be eas'd of a great part of the Burthen of the War; and that their Army, through <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s Friendſhip, would now live in plenty of all things neceſſary. As to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> they conſidering, that <hi>Hieron</hi> of a Friend was become their Enemy, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> engag'd every day farther and farther in the Affairs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that they were become Superiour to them in Strength, deliberated about providing a greater Force to oppoſe them, and to preſerve their own Acquiſitions in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Accordingly they rais'd a great number of Mercenary Troops in the Tranſmarine Nations their Friends; as the <hi>Genoves, Gauls,</hi> and, principally, the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and judging, that <hi>Agrigentum</hi> was the moſt commodiouſly ſituate for their purpoſe, which being beſides the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of all the Cities of their Dominion, they made it the Rendezvous of their Armies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving it ſhould be a place of Arms, and their chief Magazine. The <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, who had concluded the Treaty with <hi>Hieron,</hi> were now return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the new ones, <hi>L. Poſthumius,</hi> and <hi>Q. Mami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> arriv'd with the Legions, who, after they had been well inſtructed in the Deſigns of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and of the Preparations
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61906:42"/>they were making at <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to proſecute the War with all their might, and without taking any other Affair in hand, forthwith march'd with their whole Army and inveſted that place; and incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about eight Furlongs off, totally block'd up the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> This happen'd about the time of Harveſt, and the Siege being in all probability likely to laſt, the Souldiers on both ſides were wont to diſperſe themſelves careleſly abroad, farther than they ought, to Forage, and gather in their Corn. This the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> obſerving, and beholding the Fields full of <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, diſpers'd in a diſorderly manner, made a Sally upon them, as they were then buſie in their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; and having ſcatter'd them, one Party attempted the pillaging the Camp, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother attack'd their Guards. But here the Excellency of the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently ſeen, as it hath appear'd on many occaſions, to their great Honour and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Affairs. For, as it is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable fault to deſert their Poſt, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon their Corps of Guard; thoſe who had thus careleſly neglected their Duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to repair their Fault by ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Behaviour; accordingly they rally'd, and bravely ſuſtain'd the ſhock of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, tho' ſuperior in number; and albeit ſome of the <hi>Romans</hi> fell, the loſs on the Enemies ſide was much greater. In ſhort, they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61906:42"/>the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had well-nigh forc'd their Retrenchment, and making a great ſlaughter among them, compell'd them at length to retreat to their Works. After this Action the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were more cautious in their Sallies, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> became more wary in their Foraging. And now, ſeeing the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made no more ſuch adventurous Sallies, and their Fighting was reduc'd to Skirmiſhing and Picquering in ſmall Parties, the Conſuls thought it beſt to divide their Army into two Bodies; with one they poſſeſs'd the Ground where the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> ſtands, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Town; and with the other, that on the ſide towards <hi>Heraclea,</hi> in which two places they encamp'd, and fortify'd their Leaguer with Lines of Circumvallation and Contravallation, to prevent Attempts from the Town, and hinder Supplies and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence from without, and to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Surpriſes: And in the Space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their two Lines they appointed ſtrong Guards, plac'd at convenient diſtances. Their Proviſions and all Neceſſaries, were plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupply'd, and brought by their Allies to <hi>Erbeſſa;</hi> and from that Town, which was not far from their Camp, their Convoys paſs'd without impediment. Affairs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd in this poſture for five Months, neither Party gaining upon the other any advantage that might augment eithers hopes; their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61906:43"/>Engagements being, for the moſt part, in ſlight Skirmiſhes. But, to be brief, there being not leſs than Fifty Thouſand Souls in <hi>Agrigentum;</hi> this mighty Number ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them to great ſtraits for Proviſion, and a Famine thereupon enſu'd. In the mean time, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who commanded in chief, foreſeeing he ſhould not be able long to ſuſtain the Siege, diſpatch'd frequent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to <hi>Carthage,</hi> remonſtrating their ill Condition, and demanding ſpeedy Succours. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> thereupon took Order for the embarking Elephants, and all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Succours they could put on Board their Fleet, conſigning them to <hi>Hanno</hi> their other General in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Who aſſembling his Forces at <hi>Heraclea,</hi> march'd with all his Strength towards <hi>Erbeſſa;</hi> which place he ſurpris'd, being put into his Hands by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; and, by this Succeſs, having depriv'd the Enemy of all manner of Relief, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who were but now the Beſiegers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came themſelves beſieg'd; and, in a word, were reduc'd to ſuch Straits of all kinds, that they often deliberated about raiſing the Siege; and had put it in execution, had not <hi>Hieron</hi> afforded them what Help he was able, which, with great Parſimony, ſuſtain'd them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hanno</hi> having Intelligence of the evil ſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, that they were enfeebl'd by Want, and diminiſh'd by Diſeaſes, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61906:43"/>Plague being got among them, took Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to think he might be now a Match for them. He choſe, therefore, about Fifty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and march'd with all his Troops in great haſte from <hi>Heraclea,</hi> ſending his <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>-Horſe before, who had Orders to charge up to the Enemies Retrenchments, with ſhew as if they would Engage them; and to Retreat towards the Army, in caſe the <hi>Romans</hi> Sallied out upon them. This Service they punctually perform'd, attacking one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camps, who march'd out with their Horſe againſt them, whilſt they, purſuant to the Orders they had receiv'd, retreated to the Army, and joyn'd <hi>Hanno;</hi> then the whole Army facing about, attack'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them round, and doing great Execution, purſu'd them to their Camp. Soon after, <hi>Hanno</hi> ſeiz'd on an Eminence, call'd <hi>Mount Torus,</hi> diſtant from the <hi>Romans</hi> about Ten Furlongs, and there Encamp'd his Army: Where two Months paſs'd without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Action; he being unwilling yet to come to a pitch'd Battel, and entertaining the Enemy only with flight Rencounters in ſmall Parties. But now <hi>Hannibal</hi> giving notice, as well by Signs from the Town, as by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes; That they were no longer able to ſuſtain the Wants they were under, and that many were by Famine compell'd to Deſert, and go over to the <hi>Romans; Hanno</hi> was at length drawn to come to a Deciſion, to which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61906:44"/>the <hi>Romans</hi> were equally diſpos'd, for the Reaſons already noted. So the two Armies were drawn out on the Ground between their two Camps, where they Fought, and the Succeſs was long doubtful, till the <hi>Romans</hi> forc'd the Mercenaries, who had the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, to give back; who, as they retreated, falling in among the Elephants, thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, being diſorder'd, broke the Line that ſuſtain'd their Rear, which Accident diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the whole Army. Whereupon the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> were put to flight, the <hi>Romans</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great ſlaughter among them. Many were Slain, and but a few got into <hi>Heraclea,</hi> the Conquerours taking moſt of the Elephants and all the <hi>Cathaginian</hi> Baggage. But what with the Joy of the Victory, and Wearineſs of the Souldiers after the Battel, the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards, the following Night, were not kept with their Cuſtomary Vigilance; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceiv'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who now deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Safety in the Town, took this Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Romans</hi> as an Invitation to him to attempt his Eſcape; he therefore, about Midnight, with the Forreign Troops that were in the Town, took his March, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Roman</hi> Trenches with Faggots, paſs'd over their Works, and eſcap'd unhurt and unſeen. The <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſaw not their Error till the Morning, contented themſelves with a ſhort Purſuit, Attacking them in the Rear, and at the ſame time poſſeſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61906:44"/>of the Town without Reſiſtance: Where they took many Slaves, and an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Booty of all ſorts of Riches. There was great Joy at <hi>Rome</hi> on the News of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Agrigentum;</hi> every-body was pleas'd, and each Man's Courage and Hopes were rais'd, and they reſolv'd to proſecute the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of theſe their firſt Enterpriſes. They thought it not now enough to have Reſcu'd <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and Enrich'd themſelves by the War, but elevated their Purpoſes and Expectations to the entire expelling the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and exalting the <hi>Roman</hi> Name and Power; for, indeed, that was the true Mark towards which all their Aims were levell'd. To proceed, it was now evident, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were Superiour by Land, and that their Hopes were not ill grounded, that <hi>L. Valerius,</hi> and <hi>L. Octacilius,</hi> the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, Succeſſours to thoſe who took <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> would be able to go through with the Conqueſt of <hi>Sicily.</hi> But ſtill the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were Maſters at Sea, and this Regard preſerv'd them yet in equal Terms and Hopes with their Enemy. It is true, that upon the Succeſs at <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> many Towns and Cities in the Inland Country of <hi>Sicily,</hi> terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with the <hi>Roman</hi> Power by Land, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Diſcretion, but many of thoſe that were ſituate on the Coaſt, abandon'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> through an apprehenſion of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaginian</hi> Strength by Sea: Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61906:45"/>well weigh'd, it appear'd, that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the War ſtood yet doubtful; it was obſerv'd, that the Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> lay expos'd to the Depredations of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet, who often made Deſcents upon them; that <hi>Aſrich</hi> was in perfect Tranquility, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any feeling of the Violences of the War: On theſe Motives the <hi>Romans</hi> determin'd to make Proviſion of a Naval Army, to match the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on that ſide likewiſe: And this, indeed, was my Motive to enlarge, and be the more particular in ſetting down the Adventures of this War, and to treat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly about the Motives, and the Means, the Time when, and poſſeſs the Reader with the whole Series of Cauſes, that incited and inabled the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt to adventure on their Maritime Expeditions. After they had well conſider'd, that the War was likely to laſt, they thought it concern'd them to be Maſters of a Fleet, and accordingly proceeded on their Preparations, building at their firſt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, no leſs than an Hundred <hi>Quinquereme</hi> Gallies, and Twenty <hi>Triremes,</hi> which could not but be a very difficult Undertaking, the <hi>Romans</hi> being totally ignorant in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this ſort of Veſſels, which were not yet come into uſe in <hi>Italy.</hi> Whence may with Admiration be gather'd, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Virtue, and wonderful Bravery of that People, in Enterpriſes of the greateſt Hazard and Moment, who in the Minority of their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61906:45"/>Fortune, deſtitute of all ſorts of proper Means, having never till that time ſo much as dream'd of Navigation, could thus at once, and as one may ſay, at a Heat, determine on ſo Adventurous an Expedition; and make the firſt Proof of their Skill in a Naval Battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who held unconteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Dominion of the Sea, deriv'd from their Anceſtors. And that I may give a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence of my Impartial Opinion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reſolution, it may be remark'd, That when they Shipp'd their Forces on their firſt Voyage to the Relief of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where it imported ſo much to have cover'd Ships, they were not at that time ſo much as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of one ſingle Gally, no not a Brigantine; but by an intrepid Hardineſs of Mind, waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over their Troops in Veſſels borrow'd of their Neighbours, the <hi>Tarentines, Locrians, Neapolitans, &amp;c.</hi> But it happening, that the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> about that time, Cruiſing to attack them, one of their Gallies venturing too near the Shore, chanc'd to be ſtranded, and before they could get her off, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> intercepting them, took her; and by the Model of this Galley they built their firſt Fleet. And, but for this Favour of Fortune, who had eſpous'd their Cauſe, it would have been almoſt impoſſible to have put their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in Effect, ſo utterly Ignorant they were of the Art of Ship-building.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61906:46"/>
                     <p>And now while ſome were attending that Affair, others aſſembled their Sea-faring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to inſtruct them in the uſe of the Oar, wherein they proceeded after this manner; They caus'd Banks to be contriv'd on the Shore-ſide, in the ſame Faſhion and Order as they were to be in their Gallies, and placing their Seamen with their Oars in like manner upon the Banks, they there Exercis'd them; an Officer for that purpoſe being plac'd in the midſt, who, by Signs with his Hand, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, how, at once and altogether they were to dip their Oars, and how, in like ſort, to recover them out of the Water; by which means they became acquainted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Oar; and as ſoon as their Veſſels were built, they equipp'd them, and put to Sea; where, after they had ſpent ſome time in practiſing upon the Water, what they had been learning by Land, they were order'd by the Conſul to adventure along the Coaſt; for at that time <hi>Caius Cornelius,</hi> who was General at Sea, was abſent on an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> with Seventeen Veſſels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command, to give Directions there for the Reception and Security of the Fleet; leaving Orders with the Pilots to make the beſt of their way to the <hi>Streights,</hi> ſo ſoon as they could get ready.

                     <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> after this, made the beſt of their way for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and receiving Advice of the Defeat of <hi>Caias,</hi> ſent an Expreſs forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with for <hi>Duilius,</hi> who then had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Land-Forces in the Iſland: But while they attended his coming, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Advice, that the Enemies Fleer was at hand, they prepar'd to engage them. But, foraſmuch as their Veſſels were not built with extraordinary Art; and, conſequently, were found ſomewhat unwieldy in working, it came into their Heads to recompence this defect, by contriving ſome new Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that might be of uſe to them in Fight; and then was devis'd that Machine, which was afterwards call'd <hi>Corvus,</hi> which Engine was fram'd after the following manner: They erected on the Prow of their Veſſels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round piece of Timber, of about a Foot and half Diameter, and about Twelve Foot long; on the top whereof they had a Block or Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; round this piece of Timber they fram'd a Stage or Platform of Boards, four Foot broad, and about eighteen Foot long, which was well fram'd, and faſten'd with Iron; the Entrance was longways, and it mov'd about the aforeſaid upright piece of Timber, as on a Spindle, and cou'd be hoiſted up within ſix Foot of the Top; about this was a ſort of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapet, Knee high, which was defended with upright Bars of Iron, ſharpen'd at the ends, towards the top whereof there was a Ring:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61906:47"/>This Machine, reſembling, in ſome ſort, our faſhion'd Mills. To be ſhort, it was ſlung by thoſe Rings, which by the help of the Pully was hoiſted and lower'd at pleaſure. And with this they attack'd the Enemies Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſometimes on their Bow, and ſometimes on the Broadſide, as occaſion beſt ſerv'd: So when ever they grappel'd the Enemy with thoſe Engines, if they happen'd to ſwing Broadſide to Broadſide, then they enter'd from all parts, but in caſe they attack'd them on the Bow, they enter'd two and two by the help of this Engine; the foremoſt defending the forepart, and thoſe that follow'd the Flancks, keeping the Boſs of their Bucklers level with the top of the Parapet. In this poſture the <hi>Romans</hi> prepar'd for the Battel.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Caius Duilius</hi> had notice of the Adventure of their General by Sea, he left the Land-Army to the Conduct of the ſeveral Colonels, and haſten'd himſelf to the Fleet; where, upon his arrival, receiving Advice that the Enemy ravag'd the Country on the Coaſt of <hi>Mylas,</hi> he made the beſt of his way with the whole Fleet, to Encounter them. The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> on their ſide, greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joic'd when they deſcried the <hi>Romans,</hi> and forthwith detach'd a Squadron of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Thirty of their Ships, and ſtood off to Sea towards them, whom they held in ſo great Contempt, that they advanc'd with their Prows directly upon them, careleſs of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61906:48"/>any Order of Battel, dreaming of nothing but certain Victory, and the Pillage of the Enemy. He who commanded the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Fleet, was the ſame <hi>Hannibal</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and made his eſcape with the Army by Night from <hi>Agrigentum.</hi> His own Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was a Galley of Seven Banks of Oars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing formerly to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epyrus:</hi> But as they approach'd, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> became greatly ſurpris'd at the ſight of thoſe Engines we before mention'd, and ſtood ſometime in ſuſpence at the Novelty, never having before ſeen the like. Howbeit, this did not diminiſh their Contempt of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and the headmoſt, by the boldneſs of their attack, made it appear how little they valu'd them. But the <hi>Romans</hi> grappling with them, by the help of their Engines, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring by them with eaſe, came to fight hand to hand with them, upon Deck, as on firm Ground: Some of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were ſlain, others yielded upon Quarter, frighted at the extraordinary effect of this new and wonderful Invention. They loſt in the Fight, of thoſe that came firſt to engage, Thirty Ships, with their whole Company, of which number <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Gally we mention'd, was one, who eſcap'd himſelf in a ſmall Boat, when he was by all given for loſt, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perform'd the Duty of a gallant and able Leader. At length the reſt of the Fleet came up, but when they perceiv'd the Defeat of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61906:48"/>their firſt Squadron, they held it ſafer to ſhun tempting their Fortune too far, and were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd too at the ſight of thoſe new Engines. They therefore having greatly the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the lightneſs of their Veſſels, us'd their beſt skill by nimbly rowing round them, to attack them with moſt ſafety; but when they obſerv'd, that which way ſoever they approach'd, thoſe Machines were ſtill tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd and oppos'd to them, they were at length compell'd to yield the Honour of the Day to the <hi>Romans,</hi> retiring with the loſt of Fifty of their Ships.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Romans</hi> Hopes were rais'd by this Succeſs, who having againſt the Judgment of all the World, prov'd a Match for the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> at Sea, reſolv'd to proſecute the War with greater Application; and forthwith landing their Forces on the Iſland, march'd to the Relief of <hi>Aegeſta,</hi> which was ſtraitly preſs'd by the Enemy, where they rais'd the Siege, and from thence, in a breath, march'd to the Attack of <hi>Macella,</hi> which they took by Aſſault. After theſe Succeſſes, <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General by Land, who was then at <hi>Palermo,</hi> receiving Intelligence of a Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, occaſion'd by a Diſpute between the Legions and Auxiliaries of the Allies about Precedency, which came to a Separation of the Army; the Strangers retiring from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and being about to Encamp by themſelves between <hi>Paropus</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61906:49"/>and <hi>Thermas;</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſurpris'd them, and ſlew to the number of Four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal,</hi> upon his defeat at Sea, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with the remainder of the Fleet to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and being reinforc'd with more Ships and able Officers, he put to Sea again for <hi>Sardinia;</hi> where he no ſooner arriv'd, when he was ſurpriz'd in Harbour by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who took many of his Ships. Theſe Misfortunes begat a Mutiny in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Army, who ſeiz'd on his Perſon, and Crucify'd him. And here in may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> as ſoon as they ſaw themſelves Maſters at Sea, form'd Deſigns likewiſe on <hi>Sardinia.</hi> The following Year produc'd little or nothing Memorable in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</hi> But on the creating their new Conſuls, <hi>Aulus Atilius</hi> and <hi>C.

They likewiſe took <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtratus,</hi> a ſtrong place, which coſt them Time and Trouble to reduce; and formally beſieg'd <hi>Camarina,</hi> and attack'd it by Works and Engines, and, in the end, retook it, that place having before deſerted their Party;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61906:49"/>and, after having taken <hi>Enna,</hi> and ſeveral other places of leſs importance belonging to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they prepar'd to ſit down before <hi>Lipara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following Year the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, <hi>C.

But the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> obſerving them to Embark their Men, and that ſome were already put off, and got out of the Port, and that the headmoſt were a good diſtance from the reft; they thereupon tack'd, and ſtanding toward them, quickly ſurrounded them, and ſank, and deſtroy'd the greateſt part of that Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, where the Admiral-Gally was in great danger of being taken, and, only by her light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the force of her Oars, eſcap'd, after ſhe was given for loſt. But the other part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet that was order'd to follow, after they were got together, and had rang'd themſelves into order of Battel, engag'd the Enemy, taking Ten of their Veſſels, with their Equipage, and ſinking Eight: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> retir'd with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Fleet, to the Iſlands of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para.</hi> But, for as much as the Succeſs of this Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61906:50"/>all their might upon their Naval Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to proſecute their Contention for the Dominion of the Sea. In the mean while their Troops perform little by Land, inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in no Action of importance; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving increas'd their Naval Power on both ſides, they put to Sea the following Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The <hi>Romans</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Meſſina</hi> with a Fleet of Three Hundred and Thirty Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as well long as cover'd, from whence they ſtood along the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily</hi> to the Right-hand, and having doubl'd the Cape of <hi>Pachin,</hi> they ſtood towards <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> arriv'd firſt at <hi>Lilibaeum,</hi> their Fleet conſiſting of Three Hundred and Fifty Sail, fitted for Service; from thence they went to <hi>Heraclea Minoa,</hi> where they remain'd at Anchor.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had now form'd a Deſign to Tranſport the War into <hi>Africk,</hi> to the end the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> might find Employment in the Defence and Preſervation of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, while they were ſollicitous to conteſt for the Maſtery in <hi>Sicily;</hi> but the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who knew full well how eaſie it was for an Army to march to <hi>Carthage;</hi> and that it would be no difficulty for an Enemy, who had once got footing in their Country, to make what Spoil he pleas'd; made appear by their eagerneſs to come to a Battel, that they were reſolv'd to oppoſe this Deſign of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61906:50"/>
                        <hi>Romans</hi> with their utmoſt Power; ſo that the one Party having determin'd to Defend, and the other to Aſſault, it was not difficult to foreſee, by the Obſtinacy that appear'd in either, that they would ſoon come to a Battel. The <hi>Romans</hi> then took care, ſo to provide themſelves of all things neceſſary, as to be in a Poſture and Condition, either to make a Deſcent on the Enemies Coaſt, or to give them Battel by Sea. To this end, after they had firſt ſelected all the prime Men of their Land-Forces, they divided the Army, into four Diviſions; to each of which they gave two Names; the firſt they call'd the Firſt Legion, and the Firſt Fleet, obſerving the like order in the reſt; ſaving that the fourth Diviſion had no other Name than <hi>Triarians,</hi> after the manner of their Land-Army. In this Fleet there were a Hundred and Forty Thouſand Men that bore Arms; each Gally had Three Hundred Rowers, and One Hundred and Twenty Souldiers. As to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who were moſt bent on a Sea-Ingagement, their Naval Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were greater than that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and as they exceeded them in the Number of their Ships, ſo their Army was propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably greater, conſiſting of One Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Fighting Men. And who now could contemplate the mighty Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to which thoſe two contending States were expos'd, and but hear the Account of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61906:51"/>the Preparations of ſuch Fleets and Armies, without Aſtoniſhment, and taking part in the Peril with which they threaten'd each other? The <hi>Romans</hi> had reſolv'd to keep the Sea, as concluding it to be their ſafeſt Courſe, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having the Advantage of them in the nimbleneſs and ready working of their Gallies; wherefore they endeavour'd, above all things, ſo to draw up, and form their Fleet, that by the good Order and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Battel, the Enemy might be the more cautious how they approach'd to attack them: which was, in a word, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The two Conſuls, <hi>M. Atilius Regulus,</hi> and <hi>L. Manlius,</hi> were in the two Admiral-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in the Front of their two diſtinct Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, each of them juſt a-head of their own Diviſions, and a-breaſt of each other; the Firſt Fleet being poſted on the Right, the Second on the Left, making two long Files, or Lines of Battel; and whereas it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give a due ſpace between each Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ply their Oars, and keep clear one of another, and to have their Heads or Prows looking ſomewhat outwards; this manner of drawing up did therefore naturally form an Angle, the point whereof was at the two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral-Gallies, which were near together; and as their two Lines were prolong'd, ſo the diſtance grew conſequently wider and wider towards the Rear; in this manner was the Firſt and Second Fleet diſpos'd. The Third
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61906:51"/>Legion was drawn up Frontways, in the Rear of the Firſt and Second, and ſo ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along from Point to Point, compos'd a Triangle, whereof this Third Line was the Baſe. Their Veſſels of Burden, that carried their Horſes and Baggage were in the Rear of theſe, and were, by the help of ſmall Boats provided for that purpoſe, towed or drawn after them. In the Rear of all was the Fourth Fleet, call'd the <hi>Triarians,</hi> drawn up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Rank or Frontways; parallel to the Third; but theſe made a longer Line, by which means the Extreamities ſtretch'd out and extended beyond the two Angles at the Baſe. The ſeveral Diviſions of the Army, being thus diſpos'd, form'd, as is ſaid, a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle; the Area within was void, but the Baſe contain'd what we have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd. In a word, the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet being form'd into this Figure, was diſpos'd for all that could happen; nor would it have been an eaſie matter to have broken them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Generals, in the mean time, animated their Souldiers all they could in few words, letting them know, That if they overcame the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Battel, the War would then be proſecuted in <hi>Sicily</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but if they ſhould be beaten, they would then be driven to fight for the Preſervation of their Native Country, their own Inheritance, and their Wives and Children. In ſhort, they gave order for the ſpeedy imbarking
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61906:52"/>their People, which the Souldiers chearfully obey'd, every one reflected on what their Officers had remonſtrated; ſo they drew out of their Port, full of Hopes and Reſolution. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had obſerv'd how the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was drawn up, they then determin'd after what manner to form their Battel: Accordingly they diſpos'd their Fleet into four Squadrons or Diviſions, and drew it out into one long File; that part to the Right of this Line, ſtretch'd a great way out into the Sea, as if their Purpoſe had been to incloſe and ſurround the <hi>Romans,</hi> their Prows pointing directly upon them; the Fourth Squadron, which was the Left of the Line, kept cloſe under the Shoar, diſpos'd in manner of a Tenail: <hi>Hanno,</hi> one of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, he who had ſucceeded ſo ill at. <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentum,</hi> was on the Right with the Firſt Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, having with him all the nimble, and beſt rowing Veſſels of the Fleet, being ſuch as were proper to Attack and Retreat, and for their lightneſs could row round the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Hamilcar,</hi> the ſame that fought near <hi>Tindaris,</hi> commanded the Left-wing; who after they came to Engage, devis'd a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, which ſhew'd him an Officer of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> having obſerv'd, that the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> by ſtretching their Battel to ſo great a length, were by that means but thinly drawn up, they therefore attack'd them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61906:52"/>in the middle of their Line, where the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel began; but the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> purſuant to the Orders they had receiv'd, immediately retreated, with purpoſe to ſeperate and put the <hi>Romans</hi> in diſorder to purſue them, who accordingly preſs'd warmly after them; The Firſt and Second Fleets were thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Purſuit of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who feign'd to fly: Thus their Army became disjoin'd, the third Fleet remaining with the Baggage in a Tow, and the <hi>Triarians</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Poſt in the Rear of all. Now when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> judg'd the Firſt and Second Fleets to be ſufficiently diſtanc'd from the reſt, the Signal was given from <hi>Hamilcar</hi>'s Gally; whereupon that part of their Fleet which was chas'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> immediately tack'd, and made head againſt the Purſuers, who had follow'd them ſo eagerly; and now the Battel increas'd and grew warm every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and albeit the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had the advantage in the lightneſs and ready working of their Veſſels, whether it were to Advance or Retreat, as occaſion requir'd, which they perform'd with great Promptitude and Facility; nevertheleſs the <hi>Romans</hi> loſt not their aſſurance of Succeſs in the end, they found themſelves better Men when they came to the Swords Point, and they had great truſt in their Engines wherewith they grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd and boarded the Enemy; beſides the Souldiers were animated by the Preſence of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61906:53"/>the Generals, in whoſe Eye they Fought, and who themſelves ingag'd in equal Hazard with the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Hanno,</hi> who commanded the Right of the Line, and was at a good diſtance off from the place where the Battel began, ſtood out farther to Sea, and attack'd the <hi>Triarians,</hi> where he ſucceeded ſo well, as to reduce them to the laſt Extremity; in the mean while, that Squadron of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> that was poſted on the Left, under the Shoar, rang'd themſelves into a Front; and turning their Prows upon the Enemy, charg'd that part of their Fleet that had the Guard of the Baggage and Horſe-ſhips; whereupon the <hi>Romans</hi> caſting off the Ships which they had in a Tow receiv'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and fought them with great Bravery. And now might be ſeen, three Naval Battles fought at one and the ſame time, in three ſeveral Places; but foraſmuch as the Parties ingaging, were of equal ſtrength, it happen'd, as for the moſt part it doth in the like Adventures, where two contending Powers happen to be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Force, that Fortune gives the Victory to that ſide for whom ſhe firſt began to declare. So <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> not being able to ſuſtain the firſt Shock of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was beaten and fled with his Squadron out of the Battel; <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> towing away ſuch of their Ships as he had taken. In the mean while, <hi>Marcus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the great Danger the <hi>Triarians</hi> were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61906:53"/>in, and the Veſſels that carried their Equipage, advanc'd up to their Relief, taking with him the Second Fleet, which remain'd yet entire; whereupon the <hi>Triarians,</hi> now well-nigh van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, obſerving with what Bravery he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd <hi>Hanno,</hi> took Heart, and renew'd the Battel; inſomuch that he ſeeing himſelf now aſſaulted from all Quarters both in Front and Rear, and that <hi>M. Atilius,</hi> contrary to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, was likewiſe come up, and join'd the Fleet, by which means they were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being quite ſurrounded; yielded the Day to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and flying, got off to Sea. At the ſame time <hi>Manlius,</hi> who was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from the Chace, obſerving that the Third Fleet of the <hi>Romans</hi> had been forc'd under the Shoar by the left point of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Battel, where they held them ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, came up to their Relief, and was ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Marcus,</hi> who had now reſcu'd the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arians</hi> and Baggage-veſſels, and left them ſafe. In a word, this part of their Army was in great danger, and had been loſt e'er this, if the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> frighted at their new Engine, could have found Reſolution to attack them, but they barely contented themſelves to force them on upon the Shoar, and there to keep them beſet, not daring to attempt or approach them; ſo great an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion they were under of being grappl'd by their <hi>Corvi.</hi> In ſhort, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were now quickly beſet by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61906:54"/>routing them, took Fifty of their Ships with their Equipage, very few either of Souldiers or Seamen eſcaping. Behold now the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of theſe three Battels, in all which the <hi>Romans</hi> were Victors. They loſt but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four of their own Veſſels, and thoſe periſh'd againſt the Shoar; but of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> above Thirty were deſtroy'd. Of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> not a Ship was taken, but of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> Threeſcore and three.</p>
                     <p>Sometime after this Succeſs, the <hi>Romans</hi> making greater Preparations than ever, and having repair'd and enquipp'd the Ships they had taken from the Enemy, and well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd their Army, ſet Sail for <hi>Africk.</hi> When the Van of their Fleet had gain'd <hi>Cape Mercury,</hi> which is a Point of Land running out from the Gulf of <hi>Carthage,</hi> a good way into the Sea towards <hi>Sicily;</hi> they there made a Halt, and attended the Coming up of the reſt of the Fleet; and when they were joyn'd, they ſtood along the Coaſt till they came up with a Place call'd <hi>Aſpis</hi> or <hi>Clupea,</hi> where they made their Deſcent, drawing up their Veſſels in the Port where they ſecur'd them with a Ditch and Palliſade; and finding the Inhabitants reſolv'd to ſtand on their Defence, they prepar'd to Beſiege them. In the mean while, thoſe who eſcap'd from the Battel, bringing News home of their Misfortune, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were then in no doubt, but that, encourag'd by this Succeſs, the <hi>Romans</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61906:54"/>would quickly Land, and make the beſt of their March up to their City. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſpatch'd Troops to oppoſe them and to keep Guard upon the Neighbouring Coaſt by Sea and Land; but when they receiv'd Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their being Landed, and of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging <hi>Aſpis,</hi> that care was over: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they now proceed to reinforce their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with new Levies, which they perform'd with all poſſible Application, making due Proviſion for the Strengthning their City, and the Security of the Country. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in the interim, became Maſters of <hi>Aſpis,</hi> where having left a good Garriſon for Defence of the Town and Country about it, and diſpatch'd Meſſengers to <hi>Rome</hi> to give an Account of their Succeſſes, and to learn the Senate's Pleaſure how to proceed; they march'd farther up with their whole Army to Forage and Spoil the Country. In this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition they plunder'd and deſtroy'd a great many noble Buildings, took much Booty of all ſorts of Cattel, and at leaſt Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Priſoners; all which they perform'd without any Oppoſition, and brought all down to their Ships. And now they receiv'd the Senate's Anſwer by their Meſſengers, whoſe Pleaſure was, That only one of the Conſuls ſhould remain in <hi>Africk,</hi> with a competent Strength to proſecute the War, and the other ſhould return back to <hi>Rome</hi> with the reſt of the Army. So <hi>M. Atilius</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:61906:55"/>remain'd with Forty Ships, Fifteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and Five Hundred Horſe; and <hi>L. Manlius</hi> return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> with the reſt of the Army, carrying with him many Priſoners; who Sailing along the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily</hi> arriv'd in ſafety.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> foreſeeing this War was like to laſt, conſider'd on the Choice of their Generals; and firſt choſe two, <hi>Hanno</hi> the Son of <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and <hi>Boſtar.</hi> Then they ſent their Orders to <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> who was now at <hi>Heraclea,</hi> to return Home with all expedition: Accordingly, he taking with him Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and Five Hundred Horſe, came forthwith to <hi>Carthage;</hi> where, being choſen their Third General, he and <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> fell to conſult about the preſent poſture of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and concluded, That above all things they ought to Succour the Province, and not endure that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould make their Incurſions, and ſuch Spoil upon the Country. In the mean while <hi>M. Atilius Regulus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and in a ſhort ſpace makes a mighty Progreſs; all ſuch Towns as he attack'd, that had no Walls, he carry'd at the firſt Aſſault; and ſuch as were fortify'd he Beſieg'd; and coming to <hi>Adda,</hi> which was a Place of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, he incamp'd not far from the Walls, and ſat down before it. But the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> knowing the uſefulneſs of that Place, and being reſolv'd to defend the Country, march'd out forthwith againſt him; where arriving
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61906:55"/>with their Army, they poſted themſelves on an Eminence, which, albeit it gave them an Advantage againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs very incommodious to themſelves in all Reſpects; for as their greateſt Strength and Hopes were in their Horſe and Elephants, ſo abandoning the plain and proper Country, and marching and incloſing themſelves in rough and inacceſſible Places; they pointed out as it were to the Enemy, the Methods of their own Deſtruction. And ſo in effect it prov'd, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders, who were Men of Experience, ſaw well enough, that the main Strength, and moſt formidable Part of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army, was render'd uſeleſs by their thus keeping the Mountains, they therefore wiſely manag'd this Error of of the Enemy, and not delaying till they ſhould be better advis'd, improv'd the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and accordingly march'd at break of Day and ſurrounded the Hill, where they were thus incamp'd, when now there could be nothing more uſeleſs to them than their Horſe and Elephants. In this Occaſion the Mercenaries of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> behav'd themſelves gallantly, and ingaging with the firſt Legion forc'd them to retreat; howbeit, being attack'd in the Rear by another Party, marching about the Hill, they were at length forc'd to give ground, and retire; and now being hard preſs'd, they forſook their Camp, with their Horſe and Elephants, and gaining
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61906:56"/>the plain Country, ſav'd themſelves, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> purſuing their Foot for ſome ſpace; ſo they took their Camp, and proceeded as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make Inroads, taking of Towns, and ſpoiling the Country round about, without any Impediment. Then they march'd to <hi>Tunes,</hi> and becoming Maſters of that Place they lodg'd within the Walls, which they choſe to do in regard the Situation was proper for the Purpoſe they had in hand, and was of all Places, the moſt uſeful to incommode and diſtreſs <hi>Carthage</hi> itſelf, and the Country round about it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately manag'd their Affairs both by Sea and Land, not ſo much thro' the Cowardiſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> on their part, gladly liſten'd to the Propoſal, and accordingly diſpatch'd to <hi>Regulus</hi> ſome of their principal Citizens; who, after ſome time of Conference, were ſo far from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Propoſitions, that they had not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſo much as to hear them repeated, they were ſo Infamous. For <hi>Regulus,</hi> as if he had made a compleat Conqueſt, would have had them eſteem it as a ſingular Grace and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit, to accord them a Peace upon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Conditions he ſhould think fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: But the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: Mind, and reckon'd, that nothing could befal them more ſhameful and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, than what was demanded; and that it could not be worſe with them to be entirely conquer'd, and brought under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke. So they return'd, not only full of Shame to be ſo treated, but of Indignation at the intollerable Inſolence of <hi>Regulus.</hi> The Senate, likewiſe, after they had heard the Terms of Peace repeated, which the <hi>Romans</hi> propos'd, withſtood it with ſo much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Greatneſs of Mind, that albeit they were at the brink of Deſpair, the determin'd rather to abide any Adverſity their worſt

                     <p>About this time, there was return'd out of <hi>Greece,</hi> a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> who had been ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raiſe Souldiers in thoſe parts for the Service of the State; who brought a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of Recruits with him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, a certain <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> call'd <hi>Xantippus,</hi> who had been educated according to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Diſcipline, and was a Perſon well ſeen in Military Affairs; he informing himſelf of the late Defeat of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and after having been thoroughly inſtructed in their Strength, and the Proviſion they had made for the War; their number of Horſe, and of their Elephants; he concluded upon the whole Matter, and ſo publiſh'd among his Friends, That it was not the Enemy that had vanquiſh'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> but the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their Leaders.

The <hi>Romans</hi> were a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd at the Novelty, to ſee their Enemy thus to change their manner of proceeding, by marching down, and incamping in the plain Country; but being aſſur'd of the Event, they march'd toward them with all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and incamp'd within Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Paces of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who the next Morning held a Council
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61906:58"/>of War how they ſhould proceed, while the Souldiers aſſembling in great numbers, and proclaiming every-where the Name of <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippus,</hi> demanded with great earneſtneſs to be led againſt the Enemy. The Officers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this their Willingneſs, and being urg'd and conjur'd by <hi>Xantippus</hi> not to let this their Ardour cool without Action, the Army was directed to prepare for the Battel, and the Order and Manner of their drawing up intirely committed to <hi>Xantippus;</hi> who proceeded after this manner: He drew up all the Elephants in Front, advanc'd ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance beyond the Line of Battel: In the Rear of theſe, at a good diſtance, he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Battalions; in the Right Wing was diſpos'd part of the Mercenaries, and ſome choſen out of them were mix'd with the Horſe advanc'd before the two points of the Battel. The <hi>Romans,</hi> ſeeing the Enemy now ranging into Battalia, loſt no time but readily advanc'd againſt them with their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Courage: Nevertheleſs, in regard they had a juſt Apprehenſion of the Force of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, they appointed their light arm'd Souldiers to march advanc'd in the Front of their Battel; and to ſuſtain them, were plac'd good Troops in firm and cloſe order. Their Horſe were drawn up on the Wings, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in length ſo far as their manner uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was, which was recompens'd by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Depth, whereby they juſtly compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61906:58"/>that they ſhould be the better able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the ſhock of the Elephants; but they were entirely in the wrong touching their Horſe; thoſe of the Enemy much out-num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them: In ſhort, both Armies being drawn up, according to the Deſign of their reſpective Leaders, they remain'd ſome time in ſuſpence, attending the Signal to ingage.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Xantippus</hi> commanded the Guides of the Elephants to advance, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the breaking of the <hi>Romans</hi> Order, and to the Cavalry (which out-wing'd them) to ſurround and attack them in the Flank: And the <hi>Romans,</hi> after claſhing their Arms, and giving a Shout, as their manner is, began the Battel; but their Horſe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves out-numbred by thoſe of the Enemy, ſoon abandon'd their Poſt in the Wings, and the Foot in the Left-point of their Battel, partly out of fear of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and partly beleiving they ſhould find leſs to do againſt the Mercenaries, attack'd them on the Right, and put them to flight, purſuing them to their Retrenchments. But it far'd otherwiſe with thoſe who were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Elephants, they being diſorder'd by thoſe Animals, broken, kill'd, and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot: True it is, that the Body of that Battalian, by reaſon of its great depth and firm order, was not preſently ſhaken; but when the Rear, which yet ſuſtain'd them, perceiv'd the Enimies Horſe in their

On the other hand, ſuch of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army as had charg'd though the Elephants, were no ſooner eſcap'd that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but they encounter'd with the Battalion of <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> freſh, and in good order, who charging them, cut them all off. And now the <hi>Romans</hi> being attack'd and worſted on all ſides, many were deſtroy'd by the rage and force of thoſe mighty Animals, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants; many were kill'd on the ſpot by the Cavalry, and very few attempted to fly; thoſe who did, were moſt of them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was an open Country, ſlain by the Hourſe and the Elephants.

Certainly, whoſoever weighs with Judgment, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Adventure, may collect matter of much benefit for reforming the Errors of Mankind. For what is more eaſie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in this caſe of <hi>Regulus,</hi> than that the flatteries of Fortune are of all others the moſt vain and truſtleſs; and we may behold him, who but Yeſterſtay was triumphing in the Pride of his Succeſs, refuſing the Compaſſion due to a miſerable People, to Day ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Captive, and in a ſtate to implore that Grace which he refus'd them. In ſhort, the Event of this Action confirms that excellent ſaying of <hi>Euripides, That one wiſe Head is more worth than many ſtrong Hands.</hi> For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Caſe now before us, that the Counſel and Abilities of one ſingle Perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, who by their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Bravery were eſteem'd Invincible, reſcu'd a ſinking and deſpairing Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and reſtor'd Courage to a beaten and ſpiritleſs Army, grown ſtupid by their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Let it not therefore be thought ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, that we add theſe our Reflections, while thoſe who ſhall read what we have written, may chance to be edify'd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Minds in that laudable Vertue of Moderation; for as there are two ways to correct Men's manners; namely, by their own Misfortunes, and the Example of thoſe of others; ſo, tho' the one be more ſenſible, the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61906:60"/>other is more ſafe. It is therefore the wiſeſt way, by ſhunning the Perils and Difficulties of the one when without toil or hazard we may ſafely contemplate the other, and take out Leſſons for our Inſtruction at other Men's Experience. So that, in ſum, it will be found, that there is no Doctrine or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod more likely to improve us in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Life than the Experience we may extract from the Study of Hiſtory, which fairly and candidly reports to us, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of Times paſt; for by this means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it is that we attain Wiſdom and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the bare asking, which at all Times, and in all Events, will be found moſt prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: but ſo much by way of Refiection.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> whoſe Affairs had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper'd to their Wiſh, expreſs'd their Joy with all poſſible Piety towards the Gods, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Congratulations and Feſtivals among themſelves. As to <hi>Xantippus,</hi> who had ſo happy a ſhare in the Advancement and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of their Affairs, he ſhortly after (an admirable Example of great Judgment and Wiſdom) took his Leave, and departed from <hi>Carthage,</hi> foreſeeing, as it were, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had done them, being a Stranger, as it was too great for a Reward, ſo it would ſoon contract him both Envy and Danger, which a Native, by the Power of Intereſt, Relations, and Friendſhip would be better able to avoid, while another would ſtand
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61906:60"/>expos'd to Ruine. There are Authors who render a different Account of <hi>Xantippus</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, whereof mention ſhall be made in a fitter place. And now the <hi>Romans</hi> having receiv'd an account of the poſture of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Africk,</hi> ſo contrary to their Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, apply'd themſelves with all diligence to the repairing and equipping their Fleet, and to reſcue out of danger thoſe who had eſcap'd from the Battel; while the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> did their utmoſt to reduce them, and get them into their Power; to which End they march'd to <hi>Aſpis,</hi> and beſieg'd it; but the Garriſon made ſo brave and obſtinate a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that after the Enemy had attempted their utmoſt to gain it, they were forc'd to raiſe the Siege. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had receiv'd Advice that the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſitting out a freſh Fleet to attack them again, they apply'd themſelves to the refitting ſuch of their Veſſels as were out of Repair, and to build new ones to re-inforce their Navy; and having equipp'd, and got together in a few days, a Fleet of about Two Hundred Sail, they reſolv'd to put to Sea, and attempt to prevent the Enemies Deſcent. In the mean time, the <hi>Romans</hi> had made ready, early in the Spring, a Fleet of Three Hundred and Fifty Sail; and embarking their Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of their new Conſuls, <hi>M. Aemilius,</hi> and <hi>Servius Fulvius,</hi> and ſtanding along the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily</hi> towards <hi>Africa,</hi> they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61906:61"/>met and fought off of <hi>Cape Mercury</hi> with the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet, which was not able to ſuſtain the firſt ſhock, but being entirely beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, loſt in the Ingagement, and Hundred and Fourteen of their Veſſels, and all that was in them, to the <hi>Romans;</hi> who afterwards proſecuting their Courſe, arriv'd at <hi>Aſpis;</hi> where taking their Men on Board that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in <hi>Africa,</hi> they ſhap'd their Courſe back to <hi>Sicily.</hi> And being well advanc'd on their way, they were ſurpriz'd off of <hi>Camari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> with ſo dreadful a Tempeſt, that the Loſſes and Hardſhips they ſuſtain'd were without Example, and beyond Expreſſion: So terrible it was, that of Three Hundred and Seventy odd Veſſels that compos'd their Fleet, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore only eſcap'd Shipwreck, the reſt being either founder'd in the Sea, or were loſt and broken againſt the Rocks, that whole Coaſt being cover'd with dead Bodies, and ſtrew'd with the Ruines and Fragments of their Ships, inſomuch as Hiſtory affords no Example of the like dreadful Diſaſter. And yet it may be ſaid, that this Calamity was not owing ſo much to Fortune, as to the Obſtinacy of the Conſuls: For the Pilots endeavour'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the Hazard they ſhould be expos'd to by Navigating on that Coaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which borders on the <hi>African</hi> Sea, there being there not only no Harbours to ſuccour Veſſels in diſtreſs; but the Seaſon too of the Year was now improper; for by Obſervation of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61906:61"/>and ſetting of <hi>Orion</hi> and the <hi>Dog-Star,</hi> they compute and know the ſafe Seaſons for Navigation. But the Conſuls, contemning their Counſel, ſtood boldly out to Sea, in hopes that after this ſignal Victory, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſuddenly on the Coaſt, might terrify many Towns, and awe them to Submiſſion: But their Folly was chaſtis'd by this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loſs, which they ſuſtain'd upon a Motive much too little for the Hazard. The <hi>Romans</hi> have indeed this inflexibility of Mind peculiar to them, believing that whatſoever they have reſolv'd and determin'd to undertake, ought to be indiſpenſably perform'd; and they have eſtabliſh'd it into a Principle, That what they once had decreed to execute, cannot be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring to paſs: The Effect, indeed of a generous Obſtinacy, but the Cauſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of their falling into pernicious Errors and Misfortunes, and their ſuſtaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Loſſes, eſpecially in their Naval-Expeditions. As to their Exploits by Land, where the Encounter is only Man to Man, their Courage frequently conducts them to the Succeſs they propoſe, by reaſon their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures are with Men like themſelves; and yet there want not Examples wherein their Meaſures and Forces have fail'd, and they have ſunk and miſcarry'd under the weight of their Enterpriſes. But whenever, by a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious Audacity, they act againſt theſe raging Elements, and attempt to vanquiſh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61906:62"/>the Sea and Wind, they are ſure to reap no other Fruit of their Obſtinacy, than Loſs and Calamity. This we have now mention'd, is an Inſtance, and they have heretofore ſmarted by the like Errors; and they ſhall always ſtand liable to the ſame Diſaſters, till they appear better advis'd and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Weakneſs of that over weaning Preſumption, which they are apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in all their Deſigns, vainly imagining, that both Sea and Land ſhould on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions conſent and open their way to Succeſs in all their Enterpriſes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> upon Advice of this Misfortune of the <hi>Romans</hi> at Sea, were of Opinion, That they ſhould now be a Match for them by Land, whereunto they were perſwaded through the late Victory they had gain'd. That they ſhould be equal to them likewiſe by Sea, they had no doubt, by reaſon of their late great Loſs by Tempeſt; howbeit, they omitted not to re-inforce their Strength both by Sea and Land. They diſpatch'd <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> to whom, beſides the Forces already there, they order'd a farther Supply of Troops out of thoſe that were lately drawn out of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> together with an Hundred and Forty Elephants: He was no ſooner departed, but they ſent after him Two Hundred Veſſels laden with all things neceſſary for the Service of the War <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> being ſafely arriv'd at <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61906:62"/>apply'd himſelf with diligence to Exerciſe and Diſcipline his Troops and Elephants, intending to ſpread his Arms all over the Country, and to make himſelf entire Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Field. As for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they were not without a very ſenſible Sorrow, when by thoſe who had eſcap'd Shipwreck, they receiv'd an Account of the mighty Loſs they had ſuſtain'd at Sea; nevertheleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determin'd not to yield the Advantage to the Enemy, they order'd a new Fleet to be ſpeedily built, to conſiſt of Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Twenty Sail; which Fleet (a wonderful and incredible thing to relate) was compleatly built and finiſh'd in the ſpace of three Months; on which the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, <hi>Aulus Atilius,</hi> and <hi>C. Cornelius,</hi> ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embark'd; who, after having paſs'd the <hi>Streight,</hi> and touch'd at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> to take with them the Veſſels that had been ſav'd in the late Storm, ſhap'd their Courſe for <hi>Paler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> with a Naval-Army conſiſting of three Hundred Sail, and forthwith ſat down and beſieg'd that place, which then was the Capital City of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Sicily.</hi> They made their Attacks in two ſeveral places, and when their Works were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to their Minds, they approach'd with their Engines of Battery, by which, a Tower or Work ſtanding near the Sea, was quickly, and without much trouble, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd; at which Breach the Souldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61906:63"/>and took by Aſſault, and kept Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that Quarter of the City call'd the <hi>New Town,</hi> whereby the place itſelf was put into manifeſt danger; but the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants coming ſeaſonably in to the Relief, they advanc'd no farther; ſo the Conſuls, after they had put a good Garriſon into the place they had taken, return'd back to <hi>Rome.</hi> Early the next Summer the new Conſuls, <hi>C. Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and <hi>C. Sempronius,</hi> ſail'd over to <hi>Sicily</hi> with all their Naval Power, and from thence, ſoon after, ſtood for the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> where they made ſeveral Deſcents, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd nothing of moment; at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at the Iſland of the <hi>Letophagy,</hi> which is likewiſe call'd <hi>Meninx,</hi> not far diſtant from the <hi>Leſſer Syrtis,</hi> or <hi>Flats;</hi> here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unacquainted with the Coaſt, their Fleet fell among the Sands, where their Veſſels grounded, and ſtuck faſt, as if they had been a-ſhoar, and there remain'd till the Flood fetch'd them off; when with great difficulty and hazard, throwing their Lumber over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, they made a ſhift to eſcape. From thence, like People flying from an Enemy, they ſtood away for the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and after they had doubl'd the Cape of <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> they got into the Port of <hi>Palermo.</hi> But from thence, ſteering their Courſe home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a Storm took them in the <hi>Phare</hi> of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where, by a blind Obſtinacy, they were imbay'd; which Storm attack'd them
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61906:63"/>with ſuch violence, that above an Hundred and Fifty of their Ships miſcarry'd. Things happening thus adverſe to them by Sea, tho' the Senate and People could not ſubdue their Thirſt of Glory and Empire, nevertheleſs theſe Loſſes and Calamities, and the Straits to which they were now reduc'd, prevail'd with them to quit all farther Attemps of trying their Fortune by Sea; ſo they now totally abandon'd all thoughts of Naval Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. And determining to rely ſolely on their Land Armies, they diſpatch'd the Conſuls, <hi>L. Caecilius,</hi> and <hi>Cn. Furius</hi> to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> with the Legions, alotting them only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Threeſcore Veſſels whereon ſecurely to embark and waft over the Army, their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and Ammunition. Theſe Misfortunes of the <hi>Romans</hi> much augmented the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Glory and Fame in the World, and gave a new face to their Affairs. In a word, as the <hi>Romans</hi> had now yielded them up the Dominion of the Sea, it was no difficulty for them to be entirely Maſters there; nor were they without hopes of ſucceeding in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs by Land; nor did they reckon very wide of the matter, for from the time of the Defeat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, by the Aſſiſtance of the Elephants, which diſcompos'd and broke their Ranks in the Battel fought in <hi>Africk,</hi> where thoſe Animals made ſuch Deſtruction of their People, the Soldiers became ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aw'd, that tho' they had been on ſeveral
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61906:64"/>occaſions drawn up in Battalia to ingage within five or ſix Furlongs of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Army; ſometimes in the Territory of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linunce,</hi> ſometimes about <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> yet for the ſpace of Two Years together they wanted Reſolution to ingage them, or to adventure to abide in the Champain Country, ſo great a Dread they had conceiv'd of the Fury and Shock of thoſe ſtupendous Beaſts: So that little or no Progreſs was made in their Affairs during all that ſpace, ſaving the taking of <hi>Lipary</hi> and <hi>Thermes,</hi> the Army continuing coop'd up in the Mountains, and inacceſſible Places. Wherefore the <hi>Romans,</hi> obſerving this Terrour among their Legions, took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution once more, to tempt their Fortune by Sea: Accordingly upon the Creation of <hi>C. Atelius,</hi> and <hi>L. Manlius</hi> Conſuls, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Building of Fifty Veſſels, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies of Men for that Service; and now they had a Navy once again eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> having obſerv'd this Dread that poſſeſs'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, when ever he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them Battel, and having Intelligence that one of the Conſuls was now return'd back to <hi>Rome,</hi> and one half of the Army with him; and that <hi>Caecilius</hi> with the reſt of the Troops was at <hi>Palermo,</hi> aſſiſting their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in gathering their Harveſt, their Corn being now ripe; he march'd out of <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> with his Troops, and came and encamp'd on the Borders of the Territory of <hi>Palermo. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61906:64"/>obſerving this weak Proceeding of the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> kept his People within the Walls of the Town, thereby to ingage him to Advance nearer; which <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did, perſwaded thereto by the ſhew of Fear the <hi>Romans</hi> were under, and imagining that <hi>Caecilius</hi> had not Reſolution to appear in the Field, he raſhly adventur'd his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrow Straight; and albeit he waſted the Country to the very Walls of <hi>Palermo, Caecilius</hi> nevertheleſs held his firſt Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not to move till the Enemy had paſs'd the River that runs cloſe by the Town. When, in ſhort, after the Elephants and the whole Army had got over, he order'd ſome of his light arm'd Souldiers, to advance out againſt them to Pickeer, and draw them the more boldly on. And obſerving all things to ſucceed as he had projected, he poſted a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſelect and skilful Soldiers on the Counterſcarp of the Town, with Orders, that if the Elephants advanc'd upon them, to Attack them with Darts and miſſive Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and in caſe they ſhould be preſs'd by thoſe Animals, that they ſhould then retire into the Ditch; and from thence gall and moleſt them all they could. He order'd the Towns People at the ſame time to furniſh themſelves with great quantities of Darts, and poſt themſelves without the Town at the Foot of the Walls, and there abide in a Poſture of Defence. <hi>Caecilius</hi> himſelf with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61906:65"/>all his Troops remain'd in readineſs at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gate of the Town, that was oppos'd to the Right Wing of the Enemy, from whence he ſuſtain'd the Troops with freſh Supplies of Men, who were already ingaged. In a word, the Battel began now to grow warm, and the Leaders of the Elephants being reſolv'd to be Sharers with <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in the Honour of the Day, proceeding as if they deſign'd the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſhould be wholly owing to them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd all in order upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they ſoon forc'd to give Ground and retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ditch. But now the Elephants ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Wounds they had receiv'd, and vex'd with the Darts wherewith they were gall'd both from the Ditch and the Walls of the Town, began to grow unruly, fell upon their own People, and deſtroy'd many, and put their Troops in diſorder. This being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by <hi>Caecilius,</hi> he forthwith ſally'd out with his Troops freſh and in good order, and attacking the Enemy in Flank, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in Confuſion, flew many, and put the reſt of the Army to flight. Ten Elephants were then taken with the <hi>Indians</hi> their Guides, and others who had loſt their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fell likewiſe into their Hands after the Battel.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61906:65"/>well again out of their Retrenchments. There was great Joy at <hi>Rome</hi> on the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the News of this Defeat, not ſo much on account of the Elephants which had been taken, tho' it was a very ſenſible Blow to the Enemy, but becauſe the taking of thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and the Victory obtain'd againſt them, had reſtor'd the Soldiers Reſolution. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they determin'd once again, as had been propos'd (to the end they might at any rate put a Period to this War) to diſpatch the Conſuls away with a new Navy. And when all things were in readineſs for the Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they departed for <hi>Scicily</hi> with a Fleet of Two Hundred Sail, it being now the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of the firſt <hi>Punic</hi> War: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arriv'd on the Coaſt of <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> and their Troops already in <hi>Sicily</hi> being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thereabout, they reſolv'd to ſit down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that City; concluding, that the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a Poſt, would greatly facilitate the tranſporting the War into <hi>Africk.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were of the ſame Opinion with the <hi>Romans</hi> in that Point, they therefore Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning all other matters for the preſent, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd their utmoſt Counſels and Endeavours to ſuccour and ſecure that Place, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing undone whereby to compaſs it.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61906:66"/>whereby to ſuſtain or carry on the War. But that I may not talk obſcurely to thoſe who are not acquainted with the Geography of <hi>Sicily,</hi> I will here endeavour firſt to give ſome light into the Situation of that Iſland: The whole Iſland of <hi>Sicily</hi> is ſituate, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the extream Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Pelopenneſus</hi> is to <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers thereof; with this difference only, that this latter is a <hi>Peninſula.</hi> In brief, one may arrive at <hi>Pelopenneſus</hi> by Land by means of the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> but to <hi>Sicily</hi> we cannot go but by Sea. <hi>Sicily</hi> bears the form of a Triangle, at each Corner whereof is a certain Cape or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory: That which looks Southward, and runs out into the Sea of <hi>Sicily,</hi> is call'd Cape <hi>Pachine:</hi> That which regards the North, is call'd <hi>Pelorus,</hi> where the Sea is almoſt ſhut out, the Iſland being there not above Fifteen Hundred Paces diſtant from the Continent: The third Cape, which looks toward <hi>Africa,</hi> is call'd the Cape of <hi>Lilybaeum.</hi> This Iſland is commodiouſly ſituate, to Navigate from any of theſe Head-lands to <hi>Carthage,</hi> which hath been already noted; being diſtant about an Hundred and Twenty Five Miles; the Weſter-moſt Coaſt winds ſomewhat with a Compaſs, and parts the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Sardini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Seas.

They made their firſt Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt a Tower, or Work, ſtanding by the Sea-ſide, which looks towards <hi>Africk,</hi> and by their Diligence and inceſſant Application, adding ſomething every Day, they ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd that and Six other Towers ſtanding near it, and then they made way to approach with their Ram to batter the other Works. And having now demoliſh'd a great part of the Wall, and many of their Towers being ſhaken, and ſome laid level with the Ground, the Beſieg'd began to be hard preſs'd, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy having made a Lodgment even within their Works. Inſomuch, that tho' they had a Garriſon in the Town of Ten Thouſand Men, Beſides the Inhabitants, they could not conceal the Terrour they were under. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> the Governour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the part of a Diligent and Able Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, by Fortyfying and Rebuilding ſuch Works as the Enemy had demoliſh'd, by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61906:67"/>making Countermines where it was found needful; and, in a word, by endeavouring to find Work enough for the Beſiegers, where-ever they preſs'd him. His Diligence was ſuch, as it might be ſaid, He was preſent every-where; he was watchful of all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of moleſting the Enemy, ſometimes by burning their Engines; ſometimes, to the end to divert them Day and Night, he would make hazardous Sallies; inſomuch, that it might be ſaid, They loſt more Men, than if they had fought rang'd Battles in the Field.</p>
                     <p>While Affairs ſtood in this Poſture, a piece of Treachery was diſcover'd: Certain Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, of a principal Rank among the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, who ſerv'd in the Town, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Soldiers readineſs to follow them, conſpir'd to deliver up the Place; and by Night, went over to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, to Negotiate their Purpoſe with the Conſul; but it happen'd, that a certain <hi>Achaian, Alexo</hi> by Name, one who had done the like grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piece of Service in the Preſervation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grigentum,</hi> which the Mercenaries would have likewiſe betray'd to the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd this Conſpiracy to <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon, aſſembled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of thoſe Mercinaries that remain'd in the Town, to whom he imparted the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, conjuring them with Promiſes of great Rewards and Preferments to preſerve their Fidelity, and not to be Partakers in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61906:67"/>wherein thoſe who were now abſent were engag'd. Whereupon, having frankly aſſur'd him of their Faith, he diſpatch'd them to deal likewiſe with their Soldiers. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employ'd <hi>Hannibal</hi> to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whom they both knew and lov'd, having ſerv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; obſerving by the way, that this <hi>Hannibal</hi> was Son of Him of the ſame Name who was murder'd in <hi>Sardinia.</hi> He likewiſe ſent <hi>Alexo</hi> to the other Foreigners who was in great Eſteem among them, and in whom they had great Confidence. In ſhort, the Perſons thus employ'd, having ſummon'd the ſeveral Nations with which they were to Treat, and Exhorting and Conjuring them to continue firm in their Obedience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them ample Rewards from their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; they were eaſily won to give them ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere aſſurances of their Faith; inſomuch, that when their Agents were return'd from the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp to render an Account of their Negotiation, they were ſo far from conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or liſtening to them, that they drave them away with Darts and Stones. Thus by the Infidility of their Mercenaries, the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had been reduc'd to great Straits, and their Enterpriſes defeated, had not <hi>Alexo,</hi> who had already by his ſingular Virtue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> both the Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, their Laws and Liberties, perform'd now the like eminent piece of Service for them, in detecting ſo dangerous a Conſpiracy.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61906:68"/>
                     <p>Altho' at <hi>Carthage</hi> they were yet without any account of the Preſſure of <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> they were not nevertheleſs unmindful of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities they concluded they muſt needs be in, who had undergone ſo long and ſtrait a Siege. They therefore decreed them a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of as many Soldiers as could be carry'd in Fifty Veſſels, who were diſpatch'd under the Command of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> and <hi>Adherbal</hi>'s intimate Friend; who, after he had been exhorted to govern and comport himſelf as their Affairs upon the place ſhould counſel him, he was forthwith diſpatch'd with Inſtructions however to attempt ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by all ways poſſible, to ſuccour the Town. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being now departed with a Supply of Ten Thouſand Men, and arriving ſafely at the Iſles of <hi>Aeguſa,</hi> which lie in the way between <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Lilybaeum;</hi> he there attended a fair Wind, to waft him to his Port, which no ſooner preſented, but he put to Sea, and came with a flown Sheet before the Mouth of the Harbour, ordering his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be rang'd in a fighting Poſture on the Decks of his Veſſels. In the mean while, the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet, ſurpris'd at this unlook'd for arrival of the <hi>Cathaginians,</hi> and fearing, if they ſhould attempt to hinder them, they might be forc'd into the Port, together with the Enemy, by the violence of the Wind, they therefore thought it adviſeable not to attack them: So they kept their Station, having a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61906:68"/>good Offin, and contented themſelves to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide there, and wonder at this hardy At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> In the mean while, the Garriſon being drawn together upon the Walls of the Town, ſtood expecting, with great Anxiety, the Succeſs of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and greatly incourag'd at the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of this Succour, did, by their Cries and Acclamations, much animate their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friends. Thus <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by an intrepid Aſſurance, compaſs'd his Deſign, getting ſafe into the Haven, where he ſpeedily landed his Soldiers. The Town expreſs'd great Joy by this Reinforcement of their Garriſon; and tho' the Succour was great in effect, and much comforted and incourag'd them, howbeit they were leſs affected with the pleaſure of their Relief, than to behold the <hi>Romans</hi> tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſenting to their Paſſage, without daring to oppoſe them. And now <hi>Hamilcar</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, obſerving the general Joy upon this their increaſe of Strength, and weighing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they had not yet felt any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Hardſhips incident to a Town ſtraiten'd by a Siege; wiſely reſolv'd not to permit the Inclination he obſerv'd in the Soldiers, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſomething upon the Enemy, to cool without Exerciſe; he reſolv'd therefore, that their firſt buſineſs ſhould be to attack and burn the <hi>Roman</hi> Engines, while this warm Fit laſted; accordingly he aſſembled the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon and Townſmen, and increas'd this their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61906:69"/>Ardour by his Exhortations, which were ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the preſent occaſion; promiſing mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Rewards to ſuch as ſhould ſignalize themſelves in the Action; and farther aſſur'd them of grateful Largeſſes from the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And now all, as it were with one Voice, expreſſing their Willingneſs to ingage, he diſmiſt them to take their Repoſe; letting them know, that this Chearfulneſs of theirs greatly pleas'd him, directing them carefully to obey their Leaders. Then he aſſembled his Officers, diſtributing their ſeveral Poſts, and diſtinguiſhing them according to their Talents; ſome to ſuccour and ſuſtain, others to attack; giving the Word, and aſſigning the time when they ſhould Sally, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all things ſhould be in a readineſs at the ſeveral Poſts by break of Day: Theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being punctually obſerv'd, as ſoon as they could ſee to march, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> order'd them to ſally out and attack the Machines in ſeveral places at once. The <hi>Romans,</hi> who were well aware of what might happen, were not on their ſide to ſeek, being prepar'd for the utmoſt that could beſal them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with great readineſs they advanc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy, reſiſting and diſputing with a Courage worthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name; till at length, the acceſs of freſh Supplies, as occaſion preſs'd, it came to paſs, that their whole Strength on both ſides became ingag'd, and a Battel was fought under the Walls of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61906:69"/>the Town; for there ſallied out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon no leſs than Two and Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, while thoſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> much exceeded that number. But foraſmuch as this Conflict was manag'd without any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or formal drawing up, every Party en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging after their own Humour, the Action became by that means much more violent; for, in ſhort, tho' the two Bodies that fought were numerous, yet the Ingagement was a kind of Combat Man to Man, but the heat of the Conflict was about the Engines; for thoſe who were appointed to attack and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, obey'd their Orders with ſuch Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on both ſides, that the Emulation became very bloody, neither Party giving place to the other, but obſtinately dying on the ſpot where they were poſted. In the mean while, thoſe of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> who brought Fire and combuſtible Matter wherewith to deſtroy the Engines, perform'd their part with ſo much Reſolution, that the <hi>Romans</hi> deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing longer to ſuſtain the Attack, were giving all for loſt, when <hi>Hamilcar</hi> ſeeing many of his People ſlain, and obſerving that they were not yet Maſters of the Enemies Works, which was a principal part of his Deſign; he order'd to ſound a Retreat; ſo that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were on the point of loſing both their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines and their whole Equipage of War, having in the end preſerv'd their Works, preſerv'd in effect all, and might be ſaid, in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61906:70"/>ſome ſort, to have had the better of the Day. After this <hi>Hannibal</hi> paſſing in the Night by the Enemies Camp, went to <hi>Drepanum,</hi> there to Conſult with <hi>Adherbal,</hi> who Commanded in that Place for the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> This Town having a commodious Port, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within Fifteen Miles of <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> was of that Conſequence, that they thought it imported them to keep it by any means in their Poſſeſſion. In the mean while, thoſe of <hi>Drepanum</hi> having been ſome time without any Intelligence from <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> and having an anxious Deſire to know the ſtate of their Condition; all Correſpondence by Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off through the ſtraitneſs of the Siege, and the vigilance of the Enemy; a certain <hi>Rhodian</hi> call'd <hi>Hannibal,</hi> a Man of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, undertook to get into <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybaeum</hi> by Sea, and ſo bring them Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence how their Affairs ſtood. This Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking was very well receiv'd, but every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſpair'd of the Succeſs of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, in regard the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet rid at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and kept a Guard at the Haven's Mouth, on the very Spot by which he was to paſs, Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> with a Veſſel of his own, prepar'd for his Voyage, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off to Sea, got under covert of one of thoſe Iſlands that lie oppoſite to <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> and the next Morning with a fair Wind, and a freſh Gale, he ſtands away for the Port; and paſſing in view of the Enemy, got, by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61906:70"/>Ten a Clock, ſafely in, to their great Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Surpiſe, at the boldneſs of the Attempt; and the next Day he prepar'd for his Return. In the mean while the Conſul gave ſtrict Orders to have a more careful Eye on the Entrance of the Port on all ſides; and directed, that by Night their nimbleſt Veſſels ſhould be appointed to be on the Guard, while himſelf with his Land-forces attended on the Shoar. So the Veſſels were poſted on both ſides, and plac'd as near the Shoar as the Shallows would permit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Oars a-peike (as the Term is) like ſo many Wings diſplay'd, ready for flight after the Quarry they expected. But the <hi>Rhodian</hi> relying on his Knowledge, and the Lightneſs of his Veſſel, paſs'd in open Day through all thoſe Guards of the Enemy that awaited him; nor did he only eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hazard of himſelf, and thoſe that were with him, but in a kind of Mockery and Contempt of the Enemy, he would often lie upon his Oars, and then take a turn and row quite round them, as it were to provoke them to Fight. In ſhort, <hi>Hannibal</hi> happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed his Enterpriſe, and found plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by the excellent make of his Gally, the <hi>Romans</hi> deſpair'd to deal with him, and beheld himſelf as it were Triumphing over their whole Fleet. He frequently after paſs'd and repaſs'd, whereby he perform'd great Service to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> by bringing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61906:71"/>and carrying their Orders, to the great Encouragement of the Beſieg'd, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of the <hi>Romans</hi> at ſo ſucceſsful a Temerity. But we are to conſider the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he had for ſo adventurous an Undertaking, namely, his perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Paſſage and Channel that was to conduct him over the Flats or Shallows; moreover, his uſe was, that whenſoever he was diſcover'd at Sea, he would work his Veſſel in ſuch manner as if he had ſteer'd his courſe from <hi>Italy,</hi> and then bring a certain Tower that ſtood neareſt the Sea, right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; that Tower cover'd him from the ſight of the other Towers which reſpected the Coaſt of <hi>Africk;</hi> and by that very means alone it was, that Veſſels coming with a frank Gale under the covert of that Tower gain'd a ſafe Paſſage. The lucky Hardineſs of the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> gave Incouragement to others, who were well acquainted with the Place, to attempt the like; which being found of very ill Conſequence to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they reſolv'd upon blocking and choaking the Mouth of the Port intirely up, but found it a Work of mighty difficulty, not being able to fix the the Matter that was brought for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo as to hinder the Stream from remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and carrying it away: inſomuch, that they labour'd long at this Work without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Nevertheleſs, this Rubbiſh, which by mighty labour they had brought together,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61906:71"/>chanc'd on a place at length wherein to ſettle, and there begat a new Bank or Shallow, whereon a certain <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Gally, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to get out in the Night-time ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, and ſo fell into the Enemies Hands. The <hi>Romans,</hi> being Maſters of the Veſſel, equipp'd her, and Manning her with choſen Souldiers, and their beſt Rowers, plac'd her on the Guard, to have an Eye on thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that went in and out of the Port, and to have a ſpecial Watch upon the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> who getting into the Haven in the Night by his uſual Addreſs, was returning out in broad Day. But when he perceiv'd the working of this new Veſſel, that ſhe purſu'd him turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bording lightly after him according to his own manner, for ſhe happen'd to be a Gally of a ſingular Built; he became much ſurpriz'd, and thought it his beſt courſe to truſt now to the lightneſs of his Veſſel, and make the beſt of his way from them; but finding himſelf now in the Snare, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way left but Fighting, he reſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to Ingage them; but the <hi>Romans</hi> out-numbring them, and being all choſen Men, ſoon determin'd the Diſpute: So that now being Maſters likewiſe of this excellent Veſſel, they Mann'd her, and furniſh'd her with all things neceſſary, after which there were no more Attempts to go in and out of the Port of <hi>Lilybaeum.</hi>

                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61906:72"/>
                     <p>When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had ſpent much time, and had, with great Induſty and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, repair'd the Ruines, and rebuilt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd the Breaches made in their Walls; and when they had given over all hopes of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemies Works, there happen'd a great Storm of Wind to ariſe, which blew with that violence on the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it brake and render'd uſeleſs their Machines and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines with which they ſhot into the Town; and even overturn'd ſome of their Towers, whereupon certain Greek Soldiers took Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to believe it would not be very hard to proſecute what the Tempeſt had already done, in a good degree, to their hands, and imparted their Project to the Governour, who approving the Propoſition, forthwith made proviſion of all things neceſſary to put it in execution; accordingly they ſally'd out, and applying Fire in three ſeveral places to the <hi>Roman</hi> Machines, the Wind and the dryneſs of the Materials (their Works ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been long built) ſoon ſet all in a flame; inſomuch, that the <hi>Romans</hi> found it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtop its Progreſs, or apply any preſent Remedy, ſuch was their Fright and Surpriſe. Furthermore, it being in the Night, the Smoak and Fire, which by force of the Wind were driven in their Faces, greatly annoy'd them, as did the fall of their Engines and Works, which deſtroy'd many e'er they could approach near enough to extinguiſh
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61906:72"/>the Flame; beſides, the Wind, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Conflict, much aſſiſted the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> carrying their Darts and Weapons farther, and with more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and the Fire they ſhot into their Works was convey'd with greater violence, and took effect at a farther diſtance; every Object was likewiſe more viſible to them, whereby they were enabled to gall and moleſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with greater advantage, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd very much to their Succeſs in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. In concluſion, the <hi>Roman</hi> Works were in this Action ſo much damnify'd, that their Rams and Towers were of no uſe, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they utterly deſpair'd of taking <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> by force. They therefore inclos'd it round with a Rampire, environ'd with a Ditch, and fortifying their Camp with good Retrenchments, expected from Time and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, what they could not compaſs by Force: On the other hand, the Beſieg'd ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well repair'd the Walls where they had been batter'd, and Breaches had been made, gave evidence of freſh Courage, reſolving to ſuffer generouſly all the Incommodities of a Siege.</p>
                     <p>When Advice came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that a great number both of Sea and Land-forces had been loſt in Defence of their Works and Engines, and in the other Services of the Siege; the Youth of the City thereupon chearfully li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted themſelves, with reſolution to revenge
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61906:73"/>the Cauſe of their Country. So an Army was levy'd, conſiſting of Ten Thouſand Men, and diſpatch'd over into <hi>Sicily;</hi> upon whoſe arrival at the Camp, <hi>Pub. Claudius</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Tribunes, made them an Oration touching his Purpoſe to ſurpriſe <hi>Drepanum</hi> with their Naval-forces, remonſtrating, that <hi>Adherbal,</hi> the Governour of that Place, and Commander of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> was not of ſufficient preſent Strength to reſiſt them; that he dream'd of no approaching Danger, knowing nothing of the Re-inforcement of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; and that after the Loſſes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in the Siege, he would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded they could be Maſters of a Naval Army. In ſhort, the Deſign being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approv'd, the Seamen, old and new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, were forthwith order'd to Embark; and out of the Legions, the choiceſt, beſt known, and willingeſt Men, were pick'd to Embark in this Expedition; which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded would be but ſhort, and the Profit they ſhould reap being as it were certain. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being now accordingly given, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd, without giving the leaſt Jealouſie to the Enemy, the Army departed about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, the Men ſtowing cloſe and mingling promiſcuoſly a-board, keeping the Coaſt on their Right-hand. As ſoon as Day broke, and the headmoſt of the Fleet were deſcry'd from <hi>Drepanum, Adherbal</hi> became much ſurpris'd at this unlook'd for Danger, but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61906:73"/>ſoon recollecting his Mind, and beholding the Enemy now at hand, he determin'd to perform all that was poſſible for him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and ingage in any Hazard, rather than endure a Siege, which by the Preparations he ſaw threatned him. He therefore aſſembled all the Seamen and Souldiers belonging to the Fleet upon the Shoar, and order'd, by ſound of Trumpet, the Mercenary Troops to march out of the Town and joyn them; with whom being now aſſembled, he declar'd to them in few words, That he was well aſſur'd they ſhould be too hard for the <hi>Romans,</hi> if they would reſolve to oppoſe them reſolutely: On the contrary, if they, through Fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd themſelves Ill, the Conſequence would be to endure all the Sufferings and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incident to a Siege. Hereupon the Army unanimouſly declar'd their forwardneſs to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and requir'd with one Voice to be led forthwith a-board. <hi>Adherbal,</hi> after he had let them know, that their Behaviour pleas'd him, and applauded this their Forwardneſs, made them Embark, and leading himſelf the Van, directed the Fleet to follow and do as he did; ſo putting out to Sea, he drew up near the Rocks that lye on the Coaſt, facing the Enemy, who was now entring into the Haven.</p>
                     <p>The Conſul, <hi>Publius,</hi> obſerving the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, contrary to his Opinion, to make this Stand; and that this his ſudden Attempt did
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61906:74"/>not only afright them, but that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he beheld them in a poſture ready to give him Battel; order'd the Fleet to tack and ſtand back again, whereof the headmoſt were now enter'd into the Port; ſome were in the Haven's Mouth, and others not far off. But while thoſe in the Van, who had receiv'd their Orders, were haſting back, they encounter'd the others who were yet ſtanding in; by which means, falling fowl one of another, many, both Ships and Men, were in great danger of periſhing. But in ſhort, they drew out as they were able, and as they got clear and obtain'd Sea-room, they put themſelves in order of Battel along the Shoar, with their Prows pointing towards the Enemy. <hi>Publius,</hi> who brought up the Rear of his Fleet, ſtood off to Sea, and poſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Left of his Line. But <hi>Adherbal</hi> having paſs'd the Right-wing of the <hi>Romans</hi> at the head of five Gallies with arm'd Beaks, turning the Prow of his own Veſſel upon the Enemy, and making a Signal for the reſt that follow'd him to do the ſame; and being now drawn up in Front, he puts out his Sign for the Attack, and ſo in good order they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> who, as was obſerv'd, were drawn up along or under the Shoar, attending the arrival of their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which were not all yet got out of the Port, which was the cauſe of their Fighting greatly to their Diſadvantage ſo near the Land.</p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:61906:74"/>
                     <p>The two Fleets being now near, and the Flags of Defiance on both ſides put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the Battle began, where for a while the Conflict ſeem'd to be equal, both Fleets having on Board the hardieſt Men they could pick out of their reſpective Land-armies. But in the end, Victory began by degrees to declare for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who from the beginning had in many points the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Romans.</hi> In ſhort, they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd them in the nimbleneſs of their Ships, which were every way of a better Built and Contrivance, their Seamen were likewiſe more experienc'd and abler Men; they were poſted alſo greatly to their advantage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sea-room wherein to work their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as occaſion requir'd, ſo that at any time, when preſs'd by the Enemy, they could draw off, ſpread themſelves, or draw cloſe together, at pleaſure, wherein the lightneſs of their Veſſels very much avail'd. Furthermore, if at any time the Enemy had given Chace to any of their Gallies, and were ſeperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtance from their Fleet, they would then tack upon them, and intercepting them, who by reaſon of their heavy working, and the unskilfulneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Marriners, could not diſengage themſelves, ſo rowing round them, and coming on their Flank with their Prows, they Sunk many of them; on the other hand, when any of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Veſſels chanc'd to be hard preſs'd, they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61906:75"/>could come with expedition up to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and Succour them without Hazard. But we may ſay of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that all thoſe Benefits which their Enemy enjoy'd were wanting to them: If they chanc'd to be chac'd, they were not able to retire for the Shoar, under which they ſought; inſomuch, that when they were hard driven, and were forc'd to give back, they were either run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground on the Sands, or loſt againſt the Rocks. Furthermore, the <hi>Romans</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of one principal Benefit, which much conduces to Succeſs in Naval Ingagements; namely, that through of the ſluggiſhneſs of their Veſſels, and the inſufficiency of their Marriners, they were not able to come up and attack the Enemy in Flank, as occaſion offer'd, nor come and fall on them in the Rear, who were already engag'd. In a word, thoſe who were a-ſtern, were not able to come up the Aſſiſtance of thoſe who were preſs'd at a diſtance a-head, being obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Neighbourhood of the Shoar, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting void Space wherein to move, and bring their Succours where it was needful. The Conſul obſerving, at length, the Diſtreſs of his Fleet, that ſome were a-ground on the Sands, and others loſt againſt the Rocks, himſelf and about Thirty Veſſels that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him, ſtood away to the Left, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd out of the Battel, leaving Ninety Three of his Gallies taken by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61906:75"/>very few of the Men belonging to thoſe that were loſt againſt the Shoar, eſcaping. This was a glorious Action for <hi>Adherbal,</hi> to whom the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did very great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, attributing the Succeſs purely to his ſingle Vertue and Bravery: While the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> treated their Conſul with grievous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, laying the whole Diſaſter, and the Danger to which his Country was thereby reduc'd, to his ſole Folly and Temerity; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally calling him to his Tryal, and loading him with a very rigorous Sentence; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they abated nothing of their Reſolution upon theſe Misfortunes, which did not in any wiſe ſlacken their Purpoſe, to ſtretch their utmoſt ſtrength to recover new Forces for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the War; ſuch was the Contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two People, who ſhould remain Superior. And now one of the two new cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Conſuls, <hi>L. Junius,</hi> was diſpatch'd over to <hi>Cicily,</hi> with Orders ſpeedily to ſuccour and ſupply the Camp at <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> with Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and all things neceſſary; for the ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy whereof they appointed a Squadron of Sixty Men of War. <hi>Junius</hi> having joyn'd the Fleet at <hi>Meſſina</hi> that had been rendezvous'd there by the Army, and diligence of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlanders, ſhap'd his courſe towards <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> his Fleet conſiſting of One Hundred and Twenty Ships of Burthen, and Eight Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other Veſſels laden with Proviſions and other Stores of War. From thence he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61906:76"/>diſpatc'd his Queſtors, with Orders to take care ſpeedily to ſupply the Legions with all things of which they might ſtand in need, allotting them for that Service, part of his Ships of Burthen, and ſome of his Veſſels of War; while the Conſul himſelf remain'd at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> attending the arrival of that part of his Fleet which was yet behind, and could not keep him company in his Voyage from <hi>Meſſina;</hi> as likewiſe to receive the Corn the Iſlanders had provided for his Army. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbal,</hi> about the ſame time diſpatch'd to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> the Priſoners and Ships that were taken in the Battel. Afterwards he ſent <hi>Carthalo</hi> with a Fleet of about an Hundred Sail, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Thirty of his own Veſſels to the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron he had brought with him to ſurpriſe and attack the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet, riding at Anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Port of <hi>Lilybaeum;</hi> with orders to take and bring away as many as he could get off, and what he could not, thoſe to burn and deſtroy. <hi>Carthalo,</hi> purſuant to his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, falls upon the <hi>Romans</hi> about the fourth Watch of the Night; and while ſome of their Veſſels were burning, and others towing off, the Surpriſe gave great terrour to the Enemy, the danger being much augmented by the cries and tumult of the People, on ſo unlook'd for an Adventure, for the <hi>Romans</hi> haſting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly in the dark to ſuccour and defend their Veſſels, the noiſe and clamour of the Soldiers gave alarm to <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> Governour
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61906:76"/>of the Town, who ſoon perceiving what was doing, prepar'd for a Sally; and as ſoon as it was Day, and that he could diſcern how matters went, he orders the Mercenary Troops to march out againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> who being thus attack'd on all ſides, were reduc'd to very great ſtraits, which much abated their Reſolution; but <hi>Carthalo,</hi> after having taken and tow'd off ſome of their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and deſtroy'd others, ſtood to Sea again, and made the beſt of his way towards <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> in order to the obſtructing, what in him lay, the Succours that were coming to the Army, and receiving Advice by his Scouts, that they had diſcover'd a great Fleet of all ſorts of Veſſels, and that they were not far off, he having the <hi>Romans</hi> in great Contempt ſince their laſt Defeat, forthwith puts to Sea with an ardent deſire to come to blows with them, but ſome of the ſmaller Veſſels of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet, who were advanc'd a-head of the reſt, having given notice to the <hi>Quaeſtors,</hi> that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were at hand; they not conceiving themſelves of ſufficient ſtrength to deal with them, preſently took order for the ſafety of their Fleet, endeavouring to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them under the Potection of a Town on the Coaſt belonging to the <hi>Romans;</hi> but there being there no ſafe Harbour, only Coves and ſmall Retreats among the Rocks, which gave them ſome ſhelter within them, the <hi>Quaeſtors</hi> therefore landing their People, apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61906:77"/>to make all Poſſible proviſion for the Defence of their Fleet, bringing out of the Town all their Engines and Machines for caſting of Stones and ſhooting of Arrows, and in a Poſture of Defence expected when the Enemy ſhould Attack them. But the <hi>Chrthaginians</hi> being of Opinion that the apprehenſion of the danger they were in, would ſoon drive the Soldiers to retire and ſeek Sanctuary in the Town, reſolv'd not preſently to attempt them, but only to Block them up, in expectation they ſhould ſhortly be Maſters of the Veſſels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much conteſt. But having ſome time in vain expected the Iſſue, and finding that contrary to their hopes, the <hi>Romans</hi> appear'd reſolute in the defence of their Fleet, they contented themſelves with ſurpriſing only ſome of their Victuallers, and (the Station where they were being incommodious) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to a Harbour in a Neighbouring River, where coming to an Anchor, they there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd keeping a vigilent Eye on the motions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet.</p>
                     <p>After the Conſul had diſpatch'd thoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which had detain'd him at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> he departed, and doubling the Cape of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,</hi> ſhap'd his courſe for <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> totally ignorant of what had happen'd to that part of the Fleet which he had ſent before. But the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Scouts diſcovering them, gave notice to their General, who immediately weigh'd Anchor out of the Port, with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61906:77"/>to give them Battel, before they ſhould be able to join the other part of their Fleet. But <hi>Junius</hi> obſerving the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Fleet to be now near, and taking them to be too ſtrong and numerous for him to deal with, was compell'd to ſeek Sanctuary like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſuch Places as were next at hand, tho' never ſo dangerous, or incommodious, there being no Havens thereabout that could yield them ſhelter: Making account that he ought to run any hazard rather than expoſe, by the loſs of the Fleet, their Army by Land to the mercy of the Enemy. When the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had obſerv'd the <hi>Romans</hi> purpoſe, by their working, they forbore to Attack them in ſo dangerous a Poſt, but retiring to a place between the Two Fleets, kept that Station; carefully obſerving their motions: While things ſtood thus, a ſtrong Gale of Wind came up, which, by the agitation of the Sea, threaten'd a Tempeſt at hand: Whereupon the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Pilots, who were well skill'd in the Weather and the Coaſt, foreſeeing the approaching Danger, gave notice thereof to their Officers, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd <hi>Carthalo</hi> by all means to weigh Anchor and get about the Cape of <hi>Pachine,</hi> thereby to be cover'd from the Tempeſt that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd them. <hi>Carthalo</hi> readily followed this Advice, and with great difficulty doubled the Cape and ſecur'd his Ships. While the two <hi>Roman</hi> Fleets, remaining on an open har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourleſs
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61906:78"/>Coaſt, were ſo violently aſſaulted by the Storm, that not a Ship eſcap'd, nor ſo much as a whole Plank of all their Navy.</p>
                     <p>After this Diſaſter, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> began to reſpire, and conceive new Hopes, and take freſh Courage, while the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Loſſes had much impair'd their Naval Strength, were by this Misfortune quite ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, and began now to diſpair to Cope with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> by Sea, and reſolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to hold the Poſſeſſion of the Inland Towns. In the mean time, as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were become Maſters at Sea, ſo they would not renounce their Hopes of ſucceeding in their Affairs by Land. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Condition of the <hi>Romans</hi> was deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough, and their Army before <hi>Lilybae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> driven to very hard ſhifts by theſe Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; nevertheleſs, they held firm to their Purpoſe of continuing the Siege. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly without delay Order was taken, to have them ſupply'd by Land, with whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſtood in need of; the Army reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determining to abide the utmoſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As to <hi>Junius</hi> the Conſul, he after this dreadful Shipwreck, ſpeeds away to the Army, full of Anxity, and meditating on nothing more, than how by ſome new and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service, he might repair this cruel ſhock of Fortune. Wherefore, he undertook on a very ſlight motive, to ſurprize <hi>Erix,</hi> which together with the Town and Temple of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61906:78"/>he got into his poſſeſſion. <hi>Erix,</hi> is a Mountain ſtanding on the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily</hi> that looks towards <hi>Italy,</hi> ſcituate between <hi>Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> and <hi>Palarmo,</hi> the moſt difficult and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible part thereof being on that ſide which regards <hi>Drepanum.</hi> This is the higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the whole Iſland, Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted: On the top whereof there is a Plain, where the Temple of <hi>Venus Ericina,</hi> the moſt noble and richly Adorn'd without diſpute, and the moſt celebrated for Devotion in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> The Town likewiſe ſtands on the ſame Ground, the Acceſs to it being long, ſtraight, and difficult. <hi>Junius</hi> placeth on the top of this Mountain a Garriſon, on the ſide towards <hi>Drepanum;</hi> with Orders that they ſhould keep a ſtrict Watch both ways, for he was unwilling to treat the People with violence, unleſs they gave him occaſion; concluding that by that means he ſhould hold both the Town and the Mountain in ſafe poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made choice of <hi>Hamilcar Barcas</hi> for their General, giving him the Command of their Fleet, in the Eighteenth Year of the War, With this Fleet, as ſoon as he had receiv'd his Orders, he departed to the Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> with Deſign to make Deſcents and Inroads on the Country; accordingly, he fell on the <hi>Locrians</hi> and the <hi>Brutians,</hi> and ſhortly after, comes with his whole Fleet towards <hi>Palermo,</hi> near which Place, not far from the Sea-ſide, betwixt <hi>Palermo</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61906:79"/>and <hi>Erix,</hi> he took poſſeſſion of a Place, which he choſe for the Commodity of its Situation, where an Army might Incamp with ſafety, and be conſtantly and eaſily ſupply'd with all neceſſaries. In ſhort, it was an Eminence ſteep on all ſides, and hard of Acceſs, on the top whereof there was a Plain or Level, of at leaſt Twelve Miles in compaſs, the Ground yields both very good Paſture, and is proper for the Plow, it is cover'd from all the bad Weather that blows from the Sea, where there are no Serpents or noxious Animals; furthermore, the Situation is ſo ſecur'd by Rocks and Precipices, both to the Land and Seawards, that to guard the Paſſes either way, a very little Fortification ſufficeth. In the middle of the foreſaid Plain or Level, there riſeth another Eminence, ſo diſpos'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as if it were deſign'd as a Citadel to the reſt, from whence there is a Proſpect into all the Country round about; here is likewiſe a good Port of great uſe to ſuch as Navigate from <hi>Drepanum</hi> or <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> to <hi>Italy.</hi> The Acceſſes to this Place are only Four, and thoſe very difficult; Two from the Sea and Two from the Landward. Here <hi>Hamilcar</hi> incamp'd his Army, fortifying himſelf, with a Reſolution little ſhort of Temerity, having no Friend or Confederate near him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of any for the future, ſurrounded by, and as it were abandon'd to, the Mercy of the the Enemy. Howbeit he here found
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61906:79"/>Work enough for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and often put their Affairs in great danger. For Sailing out of the Port, he pillag'd and waſted the Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> as far as <hi>Cuma;</hi> and afterwards, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>Romans</hi> were incamp'd within Eight Hundred Paces of <hi>Palermo,</hi> he led his Army thither. In a Word, this Place was, as it were for almoſt Three Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Stage of ſo many various Diſputes and Rencounters, that it would be very hard to relate the particular Adventures. In brief, the Behaviour of the reſpective Captains and Leaders themſelves, may not be unfitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the Bravery of thoſe, who voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingle themſelves with the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and expoſe themſelves to fight for the Prize in Publick Spectacles: For they were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Action, and giving and receiving Wounds at every turn, wherein both their Strength, Bravery and Dexterity, was ſeen ſo many ſeveral ways, that it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for the Soldiers themſelves to recount the various Paſſages, much leſs for the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators to remember and relate them, or to make a Judgment, otherwiſe than in general to determine by the remarkableneſs of the Actions, the Courage and Experience of the Actors.</p>
                     <p>For, in brief, whoſoever ſhould attempt to ſet down the many Plots, and Ambuſhes, mutually contriv'd one aganiſt the other, how ſometimes thoſe who laid the Snare fell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61906:80"/>in their own Toiles; if, I ſay, one ſhould think to recount the many Attacks, Surpriſes and Rencounters that occur'd, and the various Scenes of Action that paſs'd, the Hiſtorian would never have done, nor indeed would the Relation be either pleaſant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Reader. Let us therefore make a Judgment of the Vertue of the Commanders, by a general Relation of their Performances, and the Iſſue and Sequel of ſo many great and hazardous Enterpriſes; tho' it ſhall be our Care however to paſs by nothing, that may become an Hiſtorian to relate, neither their Stratagems, nor any extraordinary Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which Neceſſity or Occaſion might ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to put in Practice, nor any ſingular or remarkable Action, that required more than ordinary Talents of Bravery to execute.</p>
                     <p>And here it is obſervable, that it was not poſſible for them to come to a pitch'd Battel, for ſundry Reaſons: Firſt, their Forces on both ſides were equal, their Camps likewiſe were by Nature difficult of Acceſs, and by the help of Art render'd Impregnable, ſo that each being aſſur'd of their Safety in their Works, they proſecuted their Contention by Parties and daily Rencounters, neither ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inclin'd to put an Iſſue to the War by a deciſive Battel. So that at length it became as it were a Cuſtom between them, to divide and keep the Succeſs of their Enterprizes as it were in Balance, aſſigning Victory to him
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61906:80"/>to Day, who was to loſe on the Morrow. Fortune preſiding as a ſage Judge in the Liſts, and appointing at her Pleaſure now one place, now another, to be the Scene of Action, diverſifying the nature of their Diſputes, and changing the Place as ſhe pleas'd, from one ſort of Ground to another, from Places more open to others more ſtreight and inclos'd.</p>
                     <p>While the <hi>Romans</hi> kept Guard both on the top and at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Erix,</hi> as hath been obſerv'd, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> ſurpriz'd the Town, which ſtands between, on the skirt of the Hill, notwithſtanding the <hi>Roman</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers within it. So that the <hi>Romans</hi> who were in Garriſon on the top, became by that means beſieg'd by the Enemy, who were by them before ſhut up, where they endur'd all the Hardſhips, and were expos'd to all the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers imaginable, which they ſuffer'd however with unſpeakable Conſtancy. The <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> likewiſe oppos'd the Enemy with an obſtinate Bravery, who preſs'd them hard on all ſides, depriving them of all means of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſaving by the Avenue that lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, whereby their Proviſion was not obtain'd but with great difficulty.</p>
                     <p>And now albeit they attempted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the Art and Addreſs, that is practis'd in Sieges and Attacks; after they had equally felt all ſorts of Violence, were pinch'd with extremity of Famine, and had experimented whatſoever Hardſhips, are done
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61906:81"/>or ſuffer'd in the moſt calamitous Adventures incident to a Siege; they may nevertheleſs be ſaid to have been mutually crown'd with Victory, but not as it is repreſented by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> who reports them to have been Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by the Miſeries they underwent; but Triumphing over all that could be put in practice to ſubdue each other. For before it could be ſeen who was likely to have the better, tho' it was a Diſpute, on one ſingle Spot, of two whole Years duration; yet the War at length determin'd after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I recounted the Occurrences of <hi>Erix,</hi> and the Actions of the Land-armies; thoſe two States being fitly reſembled to Birds, which in Fight ſhew more Courage than Strength, where it often happens that their Anger remains when their Power is loſt, and ſo retireing by Conſent, leave it doubtful, who had the Advantage. In like manner, may it be ſaid, to have far'd with the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who, weaken'd by ſo long a War, and waſted by the expence of ſo many Years Diſpute, were reduc'd on both ſides to the laſt Extremity. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Romans</hi> maintain'd a certain Inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Reſolution, not to be expreſs'd; for altho' for the ſpace of five Years, they had totally deſiſted from all Naval Preparations, diſcourag'd by the many Misfortunes which attended their Navigations, propoſing they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61906:81"/>ſhould be able to put a period to this long and dagerous War, with their Land-forces alone, yet at length perceiving that the great Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of <hi>Hamilcar</hi> were likely to fruſtrate that Expectation, they determin'd now the third time, to place their Hopes in a Fleet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it to be the only Means, whereby to put a happy Iſſue to the Diſpute, if Fortune would but in any ſort favour their Beginning; and the Sequel prov'd they did not reckon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs. They forſook the Sea, the firſt time, by reaſon of the Shipwrecks they had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd, and the ſecond time they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the loſs of their Fleet, in a Battel near <hi>Drepanum.</hi> And yet they wanted not Aſſurance to attempt Fortune a third time, how averſe ſoever ſhe had hitherto been. And now having cut off all the means of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Erix,</hi> they by that means ſubdu'd them, and put an end to the Strife.</p>
                     <p>But let us obſerve by the way, that this Undertaking of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was owing more to their Vertue, than to any other Cauſe whatſoever. For their Treaſure was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted to ſo low an Ebb, that there appear'd no ſort of Fond, whereby to enable them to purſue their Deſign; but their Greatneſs of Mind, and the Generoſity of thoſe who were in the Government, ſurmounted all Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And it ſo ſell out, that means were at length found more than ſufficient to effect
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61906:82"/>this great Determination, for every one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily contributed in proportion to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Fortune, and undertook as they were able among themſelves; ſome two, ſome more joining their Stock, to build and equip a Veſſel for their ſhare, on no other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than to be reimburs'd by the Publick at the end of the War. So that in a ſhort ſpace a Fleet of Two Hundred Sail was Built, and put to Sea, all contriv'd according, to the Model of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Veſſel, we have elſe-where mention'd; the Command of this Fleet was given to the Conſul <hi>C. Lutatius,</hi> who depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early in the Spring, arriv'd in <hi>Sicily</hi> when he was leaſt look'd for, the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet being retir'd. He preſently poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Port of <hi>Drepanum,</hi> and all the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Lilybaeum;</hi> then he made Preparations for laying Siege to the Town of <hi>Drepanum,</hi> but he proceeded therein with ſuch Caution as betoken'd his Forſight, that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet might ſpeedily arrive; and bearing in Mind what had been concluded in their Deliberations at their firſt ſetting out, namely, that nothing could put a Period to the War, but a Naval Battel; he therefore, purſuant to that Reſult, loſt no occaſion of Exerciſing and Diſciplining his Soldiers and Seamen in all Points wherein they might be render'd ſerviceable to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. And as he was careful to preſerve good Order among them, ſo they ſoon became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61906:82"/>and knowing in their Buſineſs, and his Soldiers ready and capable of purſuing any Orders they ſhould receive.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> very much ſurpris'd at the News of a <hi>Roman</hi> Navy, diſpatch'd away a Fleet with all expedition againſt them, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time a good relief of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Victuals and all ſorts of Stores of War. But their chief care was, that thoſe who were ſtraiten'd in <hi>Erix</hi> might be ſupply'd with whatever they wanted. <hi>Hanno,</hi> therefore, who Commanded the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet, ſhap'd his Courſe firſt towards <hi>Hieronneſus,</hi> with deſign to touch at <hi>Erix,</hi> before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſhould have any account of his Motions; determining, after he had ſupply'd them, and lighten'd his Veſſels, to re-inforce his Troops from thence, with the choice of the Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries that were there, and that then joining with <hi>Barcas,</hi> he ſhould be in a condition to give the Enemy Battel. But <hi>Lutatius,</hi> who had got Advice of <hi>Hanno</hi>'s Arrival, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, indeed, his Deſign; took on board the choice of his Land-forces, and ſail'd away for the Iſland of <hi>Aeguſa,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,</hi> which lies juſt againſt the Port of <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> where, after an Exhortation to the Army, ſuiting the Time and the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he notify'd to the Commanders of his Veſſels, that he purpos'd the next Day to give the Enemy Battel; but when, in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he obſerv'd the Wind to blow in favour
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61906:83"/>of the Enemy, and conſequently, not fair for them; and further, that the Sea began to ſwell, and threaten foul Weather, he then became undetermin'd how to proceed. But after he had well weigh'd the matter, and conſider'd, that by engaging them, tho' the Weather were not favourable, he ſhould, however, have to do with <hi>Hanno</hi> alone, and the Troops only that Embark'd with him; that over and above, he ſhould deal with a Fleet loaden, and incumber'd with the Stores and Proviſions which they had taken on Board; and that, on the other hand, if he delay'd out of fear of the foul Weather, and by that means gave the Enemy the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of paſſing by, and joining their Forces, he muſt then fight, not only with a Fleet light and diſcharg'd of all their Lumber, but with an Army ſtrengthen'd with the choice of their Land-Forces, and what was yet more formidable, he muſt engage againſt the known Gallantry of <hi>Hamilcar.</hi> Wherefore he reſolv'd not to loſe the occaſion that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd. And now it was not long before they deſcry'd the Enemy coming with a flown Sheet, whereupon he ſtood out of the Port, and drawing up in a Line of Battel, made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards them; for his Seamen being ſtrong, in good plight, and well exercis'd, tho' the Sea and Wind was againſt them, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the difficulty; and contemning all Oppoſition, advanc'd in good order againſt the Enemy.</p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61906:83"/>
                     <p>When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſaw themſelves thus way-laid by the Enemy, and their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage barr'd, they forthwith ſtruck their Sails, and after the Captains of their reſpective Ships had exhorted their Men to behave themſelves as they ought, they prepar'd for the Battel. But the Scene was now ſhifted, and the circumſtances of the Combatants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing totally chang'd, from what it was in the Battel near <hi>Drepanum,</hi> it will not therefore be thought ſtrange, that the Succeſs ſhould fall out otherwiſe. In ſhort, the <hi>Romans</hi> were to ſeek, till now, in the good Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Built of their Ships; they had now no Lumber on board to peſter and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode them, having nothing with them but what was of uſe in the Battel. Furthermore, their Seamen, who were now able, and well exercis'd, were a mighty help towards their Succeſs in this occaſion; they were likewiſe, for Soldiers, furniſh'd with the choiceſt Troops they could pick out of the Land-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> on the other hand, could boaſt of none of thoſe Benefits, for their Ships were loaden and peſter'd, and in no wiſe in condition for fight; their Seamen were raw and unable, being taken up and entertain'd in haſte; their Soldiers were likewiſe new-rais'd Men, having never before ſeen a Battel; for they had laid aſide all thoughts of Naval Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, on Preſumption that the <hi>Romans</hi> would never more adventure to Sea. In a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61906:84"/>word, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being in every thing inferiour to their Enemy, the Diſpute was ſoon ended, the <hi>Romans</hi> routing them at the firſt Encounter. Fifty of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Veſſels were ſunk, and Seventy taken, with all their Men a-board; the reſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the beſt of their way afore the Wind back towards <hi>Hieronneſus,</hi> there being ſcarce an Example of ſo ſudden and ſeaſonable a change of Wind, which came about, as it were, to ſupply a preſent preſſing Neceſſity. After the Battel, the Conſul ſtood away with the Fleet for <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> to diſpoſe of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and Priſoners, which gave him buſineſs enough, there being, at leaſt, Ten Thouſand taken. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had notice of this Defeat, ſo contrary to their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' they were ſurpris'd, yet they were not humbled, and would willingly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the War, could they have found means to ſuſtain it; but of that they had no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. For while the <hi>Romans</hi> continu'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at Sea, there was no way whereby to ſuccour and ſuſtain their Forces in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and on the other hand, utterly to abandon them, would be in a manner to betray them; and leave themſelves deſtitute both of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers for the Service of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; they therefore diſpatch'd a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Power to <hi>Hamilcar Barcas,</hi> committing the entire Conduct of their Affairs in <hi>Sicily</hi> to his Management, who, with great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61906:84"/>and Honour, acquitted himſelf of that Commiſſion; performing, in every thing, the part of a Wiſe and Able Commander; for ſo long as he had but the ſhadow of Hope to advance the Intereſt of his Country, he left nothing unattempted that was not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and Temerarious to promote it, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, as hardly any Man in Military Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance may be nam'd before him; but Fortune had deſerted the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> and he, after he had unprofitably taken all the beſt Meaſures that Experience had taught him, or Reaſon could ſuggeſt, began, at length, to take thought for the ſafety and preſervation of thoſe under him, and wiſely yeilding to Neceſſity, and the Circumſtances, and State of their preſent Fortune, diſpatch'd Ambaſſadours to the Conſul, to treat about a Peace. For 'tis fit we ſhould know, that the ſame Prudence is ſeen in the Management of a Defeat as of a Victory. <hi>Lutatius</hi> lent a willing Ear to this Meſſage, knowing full well how much the <hi>Roman</hi> State had ſuffer'd by the War; and that they themſelves were ſinking under the Burthen: So a Period was given to that bloody Strife, the Articles of Peace being a little more or leſs, as follows;</p>
                     <q>If the People of <hi>Rome</hi> approve thereof, there ſhall be Peace and Friendſhip between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> on Condition, That the <hi>Carthagians</hi> intirely depart out of <hi>Sicily;</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61906:85"/>that they ſhall not make farther War upon <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> nor the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> nor against their Confederates: That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſhall deliver up all the <hi>Roman</hi> Priſoners Ranſom-free; and ſhall pay them, within the ſpace of Twenty Years, the Sum of Two Thouſand Two Hundred Talents of Silver.</q>
                     <p>Theſe Articles were forthwith diſpatch'd to <hi>Rome;</hi> but foraſmuch as the People were not intirely ſatisfy'd, Ten Deputies were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd to go into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and after they had thorowly inform'd themſelves of the State of their Affairs, to determine on the place what ſhould be concluded; who, upon their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, after they had maturely conſider'd of all things, they agreed to the Treaty, with this Alteration of ſhortning the Time for Payment, adding Two Hundred Talents to the Sum, and obliging the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to depart our of all the Iſlands ſcituate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> Thus the War de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, which was wag'd between thoſe two People, for the Maſtery of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which had laſted full Four and Twenty Years, and was the longeſt and moſt Memorable that Hiſtory hath any where recorded; nor was there ever any that had been proſecuted with ſo little Intermiſſion. In concluſion, not to recount the numerous Conflicts, and the mighty Preparations that were made during that ſpace, let it ſuffice to note, as hath been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61906:85"/>already abſerv'd, that they once fought at Sea with Five Hundred Veſſels, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Fleets, afterwards with few leſs than Seven Hundred Sail. On the part of the <hi>Romans</hi> were loſt during this War, what by Tempeſt, what by other Accidents, Seven Hundred Ships; and on the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> part, near Five Hundred. So that if People were ſurpris'd, and wonder'd at the Naval Battles heretofore fought between <hi>Antigonus Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> they will have much more cauſe of Doubt and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, when they ſhall hear related, the ſtupendous Tranſactions that compoſe our Hiſtory. And if we ſhall make Compariſon between the Fleets wherewith the <hi>Perſians</hi> wag'd War with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> among themſelves, it will be a farther Subject of their Wonder, how ſuch mighty numbers could be brought to fight in a Sea-Ingagement. Whence it will become manifeſt, as we have remark'd in the beginning of our Hiſtory, that if tho <hi>Romans</hi> Deſign extended to the Subjection of the Univerſe and they arriv'd at their End, it will not be found owing ſo much to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Accident, as ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Authors would ſuggeſt, as to the plain and evident meaſures of Reaſon, inaſmuch as they had acquir'd a perfect and through Knowledge and Inſight into all thoſe extraordinary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes which they had made the ſubject of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61906:86"/>their Meditation. But it may be demanded, How it comes to paſs, that now at this day, when they are arriv'd at the Univerſal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and their Affairs in a more proſperous ſtate than ever; that if their ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would not be able to provide and fit out ſuch Fleets, nor make ſuch Naval Preparations, as in thoſe days? To which I anſwer, That as it is true, ſo the Reaſon is very plain, which ſhall be made appear, when we come to treat about the Form of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth. But to the end the Reader may be throughly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd, we will not decide here (as it were by the by) ſo important a Point. Let us lend our Attention then to the preſent Subject; for what we ſhall now farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver will appear worth our while, tho' we had not yet related any thing to the purpoſe. For as ſome Authors have heard nothing of the Adventures of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo others have handled their Hiſtory with ſo much Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that no profit can ariſe thereby. We may obſerve then, that in this War which we have been relating the Forces and Courage of the two Contending States, ſeem'd to be equal almoſt in every thing; and principally in their obſtinate Emulation for Dominion and Empire. As for their Armies, I believe we may ſafely grant, in the general, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were the better Militia. But as to their great Officers, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61906:86"/>
                        <hi>Barcas,</hi> Father to the famous <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who afterward made War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> may be juſtly reckon'd, both for Courage and Wiſdom, the ableſt Commander of that Age.</p>
                     <p>The Peace was no ſooner ratify'd between thoſe two States, when they happen'd about the ſame time, to fall, as it were, into one and the ſame Misfortune: The <hi>Romans</hi> had a kind of Civil War, by a Rebellion of the <hi>Faliſcans,</hi> but it was ſoon ended by the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that People, and the taking their City. And the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſuffer'd by a War with the <hi>Numidians</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> their Neighbours, who join'd in an Inſurrection with their own Mercenary Souldiers; but the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had not the like Succeſs as the <hi>Romans;</hi> for they were often reduc'd to the laſt Extremity, and fought many Battles, not only for the Safety of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general; but for their own private Stakes, their Families, and Fortunes. In ſhort, the account of the Occurrences of that War, for many Reaſons might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, howbeit, we ſhall, in few words, as it was our Purpoſe, give an account thereof here; for it will be thereby made manifeſt, by what then came to paſs, what the nature of that War is, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> have call'd Inexpiable. Furthermore, we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by that which happen'd to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> what Foreſight is to be practis'd,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61906:87"/>and Caution ought to be us'd by thoſe who will compoſe their Armies of Mercenary and Forreign Troops. We ſhall likewiſe be taught the difference in Manners between a barbarous People, and thoſe who have been bred and educated under the Laws of good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline. In a word, it will appear by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of thoſe Tranſactions, what gave riſe to that War between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that was proſecuted by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> And in regard, not only Hiſtorians, but the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers themſelves, of the War, are to this day in diſpute about the Cauſes thereof, it will not be an unprofitable Work to ſet the World right therein.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Hamilcar</hi> had finiſh'd the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and led the Troops that were in <hi>Erix</hi> to <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> he reſign'd his Commiſſion; and <hi>Geſco,</hi> who was Governour of that place, had the charge of tranſporting the Army into <hi>Africk;</hi> who, foreſeeing what might happen, did not Embark them all at once, but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſpatch'd them by Diviſions and Parties, allotting ſo much time between their Embarking, as might ſuffice for his purpoſe; which was, that thoſe who were firſt ſent, might be paid, and diſcharg'd, and ſent to their Country, before the others ſhould arrive. But the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had another Project, for their Treaſure being greatly exhauſted by the War, they determin'd to defer their Payment till they had them all together; and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61906:87"/>then to propoſe to ſatisfie them with part only of what was due to them; ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in the Port, and were receiv'd and detain'd in <hi>Carthage</hi> as they arriv'd.</p>
                     <p>But the City at length growing weary of the Neighbourhood of thoſe Strangers, who daily moleſted them by inſupportable Injuries and Inſolence, they wrought with their Officers to accept of Quarters elſewhere, at a Town call'd <hi>Sicca,</hi> whither they march'd them, receiving a certain Sum for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Subſiſtance, till their Pretentions ſhould be adjuſted, and the whole Army tranſported; but upon their reſolving to leave their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and their Equipage, as they had done heretofore, behind them in the City, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ſpeedily to return to receive their Pay; the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> fearing, that after ſo long an abſence, it would be hard to keep ſome from remaining behind, and others from returning back out of love to their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which means, the Relief they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to the City, by their departure, would be without effect; they therefore prevail'd with them, to march with Bag and Baggage. And now when the whole Army was got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sicca,</hi> and began to reliſh the Pleaſure of Repoſe, whereof, for a long time they had not taſted, Idleneſs ſoon begat Liberty and Neglect of Diſcipline; Evils commonly inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Soldiers without Imployment; and, in ſhort, the cauſe, for the moſt part, of all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61906:88"/>Mutinies and Diſorders. They therefore began to be very clamorous for their Pay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting their Merits much above their due; and altho' their Claim was unreaſonable, yet they determin'd among themſelves to abate nothing of their Demands. Furthermore, calling to mind, the many Promiſes their Officers had made them of Largeſſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for the well-performance of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the many perillous Conflicts wherein they had been engag'd, they rais'd their Expectations yet higher, and with a covetous Impatience, attended the Iſſue of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. When the Army, as we ſaid, was arriv'd, and all receiv'd into <hi>Sicca, Hanno,</hi> who at that time was chief Magiſtrate in <hi>Carthage,</hi> was diſpatch'd to them, who not only did not anſwer their Demands, but came even ſhort in his Propoſitions of what they had already promis'd, remonſtrating to them the Poverty of the State, and the heavy Tributes the Country was already under, and therefore labour'd to perſwade them to be ſatisfy'd with, and take for good Payment, a part only of what appear'd due to them; which Propoſition was not only rejected, but anſwer'd with a preſent Inſurrection of the Soldiers; ſometimes the ſeveral Nations mutining a-part, ſometimes joining in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sedition, all running to their Arms; and in regard they were of different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Languages, not underſtood by one
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61906:88"/>another, the Diſorder was thereby greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, and nothing but Trouble and Tumult was ſeen in the Camp. In ſhort, the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> whoſe Militia is for the moſt part compos'd of Mercenary Troops, have their Policy of forming them out of divers Nations, believing it hard to conceive a general Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy or Sedition, in an Army, where the Soldiers are of different Languages and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and by that means, likewiſe, that Soldiers are preſerv'd in better Obedience to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors. But if it arrive once to a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that the Sedition ſpreads through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Army, the Diſeaſe then becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, it being impoſſible to reduce them to their Duty; and the Inſtance now before us, convinc'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> of the Defect of their Politicks in that Cuſtom. For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it happens, that Armies ſo compos'd, conceive a general Diſtaſt or Hatred, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects extend beyond the common meaſures of Outrage and Inhumanity, and Men exceed, in ſavage Cruelty, wild Beaſts themſelves. This Calamity, then, befel the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whoſe Army conſiſted of <hi>Spaniards, Gauls, Lygurians, Baleareans</hi> and <hi>Greeks;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were many fugitive Slaves, who were moſt of them <hi>Africans;</hi> ſo that it was impoſſible to ſpeak to them all at once, or in one place; or, indeed, to contrive any means to do it; for one Officer alone could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, tho' he were qualify'd to ſpeak in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61906:89"/>all their Languages; it would have been likewiſe equally difficult to aſſemble and ſpeak to them at one and the ſame time by different Interpreters, who would never be able to render the ſame Sence equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to four or five different Nations at once. Their beſt courſe, then, was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Commanders, to deal with, and harangue their ſeveral Troops, when they had any thing to command or perſwade the Soldiers. <hi>Hanno,</hi> accordingly gave out his Orders to them as he was able; while thoſe who were to execute them, had themſelves, but an imperfect underſtanding of what was order'd; others, tho' they underſtood what was directed them to ſay, yet reported quite the contrary to the Soldiers; ſo that, what through Ignorance, what through Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Diſtruſts and Jealouſies daily increas'd, the Soldiers Complaints not duly heard, and the Conſpiracy and Diſaffection grew ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſtronger. The Army thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves outrag'd, that inſtead of ſending to them Officers, under whom they had ſerv'd in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who knew their Merits, and who had ſo often aſſur'd them of Rewards; the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had ſent them one, who knew them not, and had no manner of knowledge of their Services. In ſhort, as they ſlighted and contemn'd <hi>Hanno,</hi> ſo they began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt their own Officers; and thus inrag'd as they were, with their Arms in their hands,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61906:89"/>they march'd Twenty Thouſand of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Carthage,</hi> and incamp'd near <hi>Tunes,</hi> about Fiften Miles from the City.</p>
                     <p>And now the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of their Weakneſs, when it was too late, and no preſent Remedy could be had; for it was a mighty Fault in them to permit ſuch a Body of Strangers to Aſſemble all in one Place, while at the ſame time they well knew, that in caſe any Diſorder ſhould ariſe, they had not Strength ſufficient at home to appear in their own Defence. Another great Error they committed, in permitting their Wives, Children, and their Equipage to go out of the City, which, like ſo many Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, would have ſerv'd, not only to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd them in their Duty, but would have gone far towards compoſing the Differences that were ariſen between them. In a word, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> affrighted to behold ſuch an Army, as one may ſay, of Enemies at their Gates, labour'd all they could to win them to Obedience and good Order. They ſent them ſupplies of Proviſion, which they bought at their own Rates; they diſpatch'd Deputies to them likewiſe out of the Body of the Senate, who aſſur'd them of all they ſhould demand, that was in the Power of the State to perform: But theſe Mutineers ſound ſomething new to require every day, and the Fear they perceiv'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to be in, added to their Inſolence; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61906:90"/>ſerv'd againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> they took for granted that neither the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> nor any other People whatſoever, would have Courage to oppoſe them, or offer them Battel in the Field. No ſooner therefore had they adjuſted their Demands of Pay, but they proceeded to further Exactions; they requir'd payment for the Horſes they had loſt in the Service; when that was agreed to, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded payment for the Corn that had been deliver'd them ſhort of their Allowance for many Years paſt, and they would be paid too at the Rate that it had at any time been ſold at, in the utmoſt Extremity of the War. In brief, as there were many Mutinous and Seditious Perſons in the Army, ſo thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated new Exorbitances, and every day found freſh occaſion of Complaint, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their Agreement by impoſſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were reſolv'd to agree to every thing, and now the Mutiny began to be appeas'd, when they underſtood that an Officer ſhould be ſent them under whom they had ſerv'd in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who ſhould have Power to Agree and Adjuſt with them all their Pretences. They were not pleas'd with <hi>Hamilcar Barcas,</hi> under whom they had born Arms, believing he had been the occaſion of the ill Treatment they had found, becauſe he never came near them; and they believ'd too, that he had quitted his Command of his own Motion. On the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61906:90"/>other hand they had an Affection to <hi>Geſco,</hi> who had likewiſe commanded them in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and who had appear'd their Friend and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in many Occaſions, eſpecially in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Tranſportation, ſo they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to chuſe him as Arbitrator in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters depending. He therefore embarks, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Money with him, and upon his Arrival at <hi>Tunes,</hi> firſt calls an Aſſembly of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers, and then he Summons them ſeparately, Nation by Nation. Where, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had gently reprov'd them for their paſt Behaviour, he Remonſtrates to them the preſent State of Affairs, and above all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to perſwade them to continue their Affection and Duty to a Government under which they had ſo long Serv'd, and taken Pay; and, in ſhort, exhorted them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Remainder of their Pay as it appear'd due. Among the Mutineers there happen'd to be one <hi>Spendius</hi> a <hi>Campanian,</hi> who had been a Slave to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had harbour'd himſelf among the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> He was ſtrong of Body, and in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Danger very forward; this Fellow, fearing to fall into the hands of his Maſter, for by the Cuſtom of <hi>Rome</hi> his Fault was puniſh'd with Death; labour'd both with Words and Actions, to trouble and perplex the Treaty they were upon; and to hinder by all means poſſible their Agreement with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Another there was,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61906:91"/>whoſe Name was <hi>Matho,</hi> who was an <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> of free condition, and a Soldier among them, having been an active Stirrer in this Conſpiracy, and out of fear of Puniſhment, join'd with <hi>Spendius</hi> to obſtruct the Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, poſſeſſing the <hi>Africans,</hi> That as ſoon as the Strangers ſhould be paid, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd to their Country, it would be their lot to Pay for all, and that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would take ſuch Revenge on them, for the Injuries which had been done them, that all <hi>Africa</hi> ſhould tremble at it. The Soldiers grew hereupon inrag'd a-new, and in regard they were not likely to receive of <hi>Geſco</hi> any other Satisfaction than their Arrears of Pay; what was due for their Horſes and Bread, being reſpited to another time, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took thence occaſion of freſh Diſorders, and aſſembled in the publick Meeting-place in a mutinous manner. To <hi>Spendius</hi> and <hi>Matho</hi> they lent a willing Ear, who rail'd both againſt <hi>Geſco</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and if any one preſum'd to offer them temperate Counſel, he was forthwith ſton'd to Death, even before it could be underſtood what the Purport of his Diſcourſe was, whether for or againſt <hi>Spendius,</hi> and now great ſlaughter was made both of People of publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Condition, and nothing was heard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Tumult, but, Kill, kill; and what greatly augmented the Rage of thoſe People, was the exceſs of Wine they had drunk, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61906:91"/>newly riſen from their Repaſt. So that the word Kill reſounding ſuddenly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Camp, there was no eſcaping for any one againſt whom they conceiv'd any diſtruſt or diſtaſte. In a Word, there being now none who preſum'd to open his Mouth to divert their Determinations, they choſe <hi>Spendius</hi> and <hi>Matho</hi> for their Leaders and Commanders in Chief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geſco</hi> was not without a due Sence of the Danger he was in among theſe People, but he let that Conſideration give place to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he ow'd his Country; he fore-ſaw that if this Mutiny once came to a head, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth would be driven to great ſtraits, to prevent which, he was willing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to any hazard. He therefore with great Conſtancy of Mind purſu'd his Purpoſe of reducing them to their Duty by all means poſſible: Sometimes he treated with their Officers, ſometimes with the ſundry Nations apart; but now being in preſent want of Bread in the Camp, they impatiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it of <hi>Geſco;</hi> he, as it chanc'd, in a ſort of Contempt, to reprove their Inſolence, bad them go to <hi>Matho</hi> their Captain; this put all in a Flame, ſo that without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay or reſpect, they ſeize on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that was brought, and lay ready told in order to their Payment, and arreſted <hi>Geſco,</hi> and all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> who accompany'd him.</p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:61906:92"/>
                     <p>And now <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius</hi> conceiving the only way to put matters paſt Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to come to open Hoſtility, was to ingage the Soldiers in ſome ſuch violent Action, as ſhould be a manifeſt breach of their Duty, and a violation of the Treaty they were upon. Wherefore they fomented with all their Art and Induſtry, this Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Proceeding of the Multitude; who now had not only ſeiz'd on the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Money and their Baggage, but laying vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on <hi>Geſco</hi> and his Followers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to Priſon, loading them with Irons, and then moſt impiouſly conſpir'd, and, againſt the Law of Nations, declar'd War againſt the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> This then was the Beginning and the Cauſe of the War with the Mercenaries, which was call'd the <hi>African</hi> War. After this, <hi>Matho</hi> diſpatch'd Deputies to the Cities round about, exhorting them to think on their Liberty; to ſend him Succours; and to enter into a Confederacy with him. And now the ſeveral Heads of the Faction finding the <hi>Africans</hi> diſpos'd to Revolt, and to ſhake off the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Yoak; and that Supplies both of Men and Proviſions were diſpatch'd to them from al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Parts, they divided their Army into Two: One they ſent againſt <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and the other towards <hi>Hippona,</hi> which two Places had refus'd to join with them in their Defection from the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>

                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61906:92"/>
                     <p>The Cuſtom of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had ever been to Suſtain themſelves out of the Fruits and Growth of the Country, and the greateſt part of their Treaſure and Income, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they defray'd their Wars, and made their Military Preparations, aroſe out of their Revenues in <hi>Africa.</hi> But their Armies in all their Expeditions were ever compos'd of Strangers, by which means it will appear, and by what we have related, that all things conſpir'd at once to their Damage, and what had been their Support, converted to their Diſadvantage, ſo that from Conſternation they fell to Deſpair; for ſo great was their Surprize, that nothing could poſſibly have befaln them ſo remote from their Expectation. For after the War of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which had conſum'd their Treaſure, (being now aſſur'd of Peace) they promis'd themſelves a breathing Space of Tranquility; and took for granted, their Condition would be at leaſt Supportable. But thoſe Hopes ſoon vaniſh'd, and were chang'd into the ſad Proſpect of a War more cruel and dangerous. Their Conteſt with the <hi>Romans,</hi> was for the Dominion of <hi>Sicily</hi> only; now they were to Fight for their own proper Safety, and the Preſervation of the Commonwealth; and all this without any Stores of War, Armies or Fleets, or any Proviſion towards it; after ſo many Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Conflicts wherein they had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd. Furthermore, they were without
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61906:93"/>either Money, or hopes of Friends to whom they might have recourſe for Succour. And here they came to perceive the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Foreign and remote War, beyond the Seas; and Civil Diſſenſion at their own Doors.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, this People were of themſelves the Authors of their own Calamities; for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the firſt War, with what grievous Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny did they oppreſs the poor <hi>Africans,</hi> thinking they ſavour'd them, by exacting from them but the one half of their Income, continuing the ſame Levies upon their Towns and Cities in time of Peace, as were drawn from them to carry on the War; and this was extorted with that rigour that the pooreſt Subject was not exempted. And whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were to elect new Magiſtrates for the Provinces, the Choice never fell on thoſe who were likely to Govern the People with Lenity and Moderation, but on ſuch whoſe Rigour promis'd them the greateſt Fruits of their Oppreſſion, by draining them of their Money to furniſh out their Fleets and their Armies; and, in a word, to Miniſter to the Ambition of the Republick; among whom <hi>Hanno</hi> was a principal Miniſter. All this conſider'd, the <hi>Africans</hi> were not likely to be backward to Rebel; to whom the bare Report only of what was tranſacting was ſufficient to engage them. The Women themſelves, who had ſo often ſeen their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61906:93"/>and Husbands dragg'd to Priſon by the Tax-gatherers, were in every Town active in promoting the Revolt, combining among themſelves to refuſe nothing that could be compaſs'd to carry on the War, ſparing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Ornaments, nor precious Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to raiſe Pay for the Armies: Inſomuch that <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius</hi> were ſo plentifully ſupply'd with Mony, that they had not only ſufficient to Pay the Arrears that were due, which they had aſſur'd them of, the better to ingage them to their Purpoſe: but were inabled to ſuſtain the Expence and growing Charge of the Army. For Wiſe Officers extend their Proſpect beyond the preſent Occaſion. And now, notwithſtanding the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were heavily oppreſs'd by theſe Misfortunes, they ommitted not however to provide the beſt Means for their Defence. The Conduct of the War they gave to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> of whoſe Service they had heretofore made uſe, in the Conqueſt of that part of their Dominions lying about <hi>Hecatompolis.</hi> They levy'd Soldiers likewiſe, from all Parts, and commanded all their Citizens, who were able to bear Arms, to be Muſter'd, they exercis'd the Horſe alſo that belong'd to the City, and repair'd their decay'd Ships, and order'd the Building of new ones. In the mean time <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius,</hi> who had (Seventy Thouſand <hi>Africans</hi> in their Army) beſieg'd <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> and <hi>Hippona</hi> at one
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61906:94"/>and the ſame time; being without any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Enemy; for they kept Guard in their Camp near <hi>Tunes,</hi> by which means the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were debarr'd all Commerce and Communication with <hi>Africa.</hi> For <hi>Carthage</hi> is ſituate on a Peninſula which runs far out into the Sea, and is bounded by that on the one ſide, and the other by Mariſh and unpaſſable Grounds; ſo that the Iſthmus that joins it to the Continent, is not three Miles broad; <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> ſtands not far from that Part of <hi>Carthage</hi> which regards the Sea, and <hi>Tunes</hi> on the ſide of the Mariſh Ground: So that the Enemy being incamp'd in thoſe two Places, did in effect not only block up the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> from the Continent, but even alarm'd the City itſelf, marching ſometimes by Night, ſome times by Day, to their very Walls; filling the Inhabitants with great Fear and Diſorder. Neverthelsſs, <hi>Hanno</hi> omitted no part of his Charge, making all Proviſion poſſible for the War, wherein he was very capable, being well practis'd in Affairs of that Nature, but he was found no able Soldier, whenſoever he march'd againſt the Enemy; for he knew not how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Occaſions of Advantage, and not only manifeſted his Want of Judgment, but of Courage, too when it came to the Tryal. For marching to the Relief of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> when he had terrify'd and diſorder'd the Enemy by the help of his Elephants, whereof he had an
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61906:94"/>Hundred in his Army, and Victory had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declar'd for him; yet through his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, not only the Army, but the Town it ſelf, was in great hazard of being loſt; for having brought from <hi>Carthage</hi> all ſorts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, Engines, and Equipage of War, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Attack of Towns, and incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> he aſſaulted the Enemies Works, who, not able to ſtand the Force of the Elephants, were forc'd to quit their Camp. Many were ſlain by thoſe Animals, and ſuch as eſcap'd, retir'd to a neighbouring Mountain for Safety, which being ſtrong by Situation, and over-grown with Wood, they thought themſelves there ſecure enough. While <hi>Hanno,</hi> who had been accuſtom'd to make War with the <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who, upon any Defeat, are wont to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat as far from Danger as they are able, often ſlying for Two or Three Days together: thought himſelf ſecure of the Victory, and that the Enemy had been totally defeated, inſomuch that he neglected the Guard of his Camp, left his Soldiers at Liberty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into the Town, there made good Cheer and thought of nothing but his Eaſe. In the mean time the Enemy, who had been well train'd in War, and had learn'd of their Leader <hi>Hamilcar</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> how to ſuſtain ſuch Shocks and Rencounters, laid hold on this occaſion; for being us'd to fly before an Enemy, and to Face again, and Attack in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61906:95"/>one and the ſame Day thoſe who had purſu'd them; and receiving Intelligence that <hi>Hanno</hi> was retir'd into the Town, and that the Soldiers, confident of their Victory, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their Duty in Guarding the Camp; they march'd forthwith down, and attack'd their Retrenchments, kill'd a great number, and conſtrain'd the reſt ſhamefully to Retreat into the Town; taking all their Baggage, Engines, and Equipage of War. Nor was this the only Occaſion wherein <hi>Hanno</hi> had given Marks of his Inſufficiency; for this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſter was follow'd by another, ſoon after, near a Town call'd <hi>Gorza:</hi> For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he lay incamp'd in the Face of the Enemy, and had it in his power totally to have ſubdu'd them; after having twice worſted them in Battel, nevertheleſs, by his Imprudence, the Opportunity was loſt.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> diſſatisfy'd with the Conduct of <hi>Hanno,</hi> gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Army once again to <hi>Hamilcar Barcas</hi> and diſpatch'd him to the Field with Seventy Elephants, and all the Forreigners they could get together, with the Militia of the City, both Horſe and Foot; amounting in all to about ten thouſand Men. With this Army he marched againſt the Enemy, whom he ſurpris'd in ſuch manner, that they were conſtrain'd to remove their Camp, and raiſe their Siege from before <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica;</hi> for which Action alone he was judg'd worthy of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61906:95"/>great Character he had obtain'd in the World, and confirm'd the Hopes they had conceiv'd of his Succeſs; and here we have an occaſion to make recital of his Adventures during this Expedition.</p>
                     <p>On the narrow, or ſlip of Land, and that joins <hi>Carthage</hi> to the Continent, ſtand two Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, almoſt inacceſſible on the ſide that looks towards the Country; in thoſe two Mountains there are two Ways or Paſſes made by Art, which lead into the Champaign. Theſe Mountains were poſſes'd by <hi>Matho,</hi> who had plac'd Guards in every needful place. Furthermore, the River <hi>Macar</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all paſſage from <hi>Carthage</hi> into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on that ſide, which is ſo deep, as to be no where fordable; over which River there is but one Bridge, near which there ſtands a Village, which <hi>Matho</hi> poſſeſs'd likewiſe, and guarded with great Vigilance; by this means, not only an Army could not paſs, but even a ſingle Man could hardly get paſſage undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd of the Enemy: This was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd by <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> who, having a watchful Eye every-where, lights, at length, on a Stratagem which afforded him the only means to get his Paſſage. He had remark'd, that upon the blowing of certain Winds, the Mouth of the River us'd to be choak'd up with Sand, which was wont to bank up in nature of a Bar, and afforded a kind of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Paſſage over the River; he therefore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61906:96"/>march'd his Army to the River's Mouth, where he halted, without communicating the reaſon to any Body, till thoſe favourable Winds, we mention'd, ſhould blow; which no ſooner happen'd, but he marcheth his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by Night, over the River; without giving the leaſt Suſpicion to the Enemy: This Action (wherein he perform'd great Service, and thought to be impoſſible) was matter of great Aſtoniſhment, both to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the Enemy; and now <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> gets into the Plains, and marcheth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that guarded the Bridge. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> receiving Advice of what had paſs'd, gets before him, and marches on the one ſide with a Body of above Ten Thouſand Men, which he drew out of the Town near the Bridge; and on the other were at leaſt Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Thouſand, which he order'd from the Camp before <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> with purpoſe, by that manner of proceeding, to ſurround and hem <hi>Hamilcar</hi>'s Army in; under which hopes, the Soldiers became ſo attentive, that they punctually obey'd the Orders they receiv'd, and mutually animated each other to do their Duty as they ought. In the mean time, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> advances with the Elephants in his Front, then the Cavalry, with the light arm'd Foot, and thoſe who carry'd Bucklers, in the Rear. But when he obſerv'd the Enemy to approach with Precipitation, and, as it were, without any Order, he preſently chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61906:96"/>the Order of his Battel, commanding thoſe who were in the Rear to advance to the Front; who marching with a compaſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came oppoſs'd in Battel to the Enemy; who taking thoſe Motions to be an effect of Fear, and a ſort of Retreat, attack'd them with great Reſolution, tho' without any Order. But <hi>Hamilcar</hi>'s Horſe were no ſooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and thoſe who follow'd them boldly ſuſtaining them; and altogether coming to the Charge, when the Enemy who came in confuſion, and in haſte, began to fear; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo contrary to their Opinion, the Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that was made; which not being able to endure they ſoon betook themſelves to flight, one of their Parties encountring with another of their own, which was coming to their Relief, took them for Enemies in the Fright, and ingaging, defeated one the other; moſt of the reſt were deſtroy'd by the Horſe and the Elephants. In this Conflict there dy'd of the <hi>Africans</hi> near Six Thouſand Men, and about Two Thouſand were taken Priſoners; the Remainder, ſome got into the Town near the Bridge, and ſome into the Camp before <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica.</hi> After the Victory, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> purſues the Straglers every-where, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Town by the Bridge which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had abandon'd, and retir'd to <hi>Tunes;</hi> and forraging the Country round about, ſome Towns yielding to him out of Fear, others were reduc'd by force; by which means
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61906:97"/>having, in a good degree recover'd the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> form the Fear they were under, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt at the point of Deſpair; he gave them new Courage, and lent them more Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in danger.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Matho,</hi> who continu'd the Siege of <hi>Hippona,</hi> advis'd <hi>Spendius</hi> and <hi>Autaritus,</hi> who was Chief among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> to be careful not to loſe ſight of the Enemy, but to take care, however, not to be ſurpris'd in the Champion Country, by reaſon of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi>'s Superiour Strength in Horſe and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, but to keep the skirts of the Hills, and to march and incamp as near the Enemy as they could, and to take the advantage of attacking them, when they ſhould perceive them at any time incumber'd or moleſted in their March; but while he gave them this Counſel, he forgot not to ſolicit the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Africans</hi> for Succours, and to incite them to make uſe of the preſent Occaſion to recover their Liberty. So <hi>Spendius</hi> made choice of Six Thouſand Men, out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations that were incamp'd at <hi>Tunes,</hi> to march, and attend the Motions of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> whereſoever they went; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he was advis'd, the Foot of the Mountains. He took likewiſe with him, the Horſe of <hi>Autaritus</hi> amounting to Two Thouſand <hi>Gauls,</hi> (all the reſt of that Nation, who had ſerv'd at <hi>Erix</hi> under <hi>Autaritus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken Pay with the <hi>Romans.</hi>) And while
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61906:97"/>
                        <hi>Hamilcar</hi> was incamp'd in a Plain, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides with Hills, <hi>Spendius</hi> receives Succours both of <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Numidians,</hi> and reſolves to attack the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> by ſurrounding them, appointing the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to ingage in the Rear, the <hi>Africans</hi> in the Front, reſolving himſelf to fall on their Flank. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were hereby reduc'd to very great ſtraits, looking on the Danger to be almoſt inevitable. But it happen'd that at this time there was a certain <hi>Numidian</hi> in the Enemies Army, call'd <hi>Naravaſus,</hi> a Man of Account both for Nobility and Courage: He had heretofore been of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Party, on the account of the Friendſhip that had been between them and his Father; and now charm'd by the Vertue and Fame of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar,</hi> he was reſolv'd to renew old Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and conceiving this a proper occaſion to put his Purpoſe in effect, he determin'd to find out <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> and contract this new-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Friendſhip with him: Accordingly he advanceth towards their Camp, attended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with about an Hundred <hi>Numidians;</hi> and coming near their Lines, he there halts, and with a noble Aſſurance, makes a Sign with his Hand, that he had ſomething to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them. <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> not a little wondring at the Hardineſs of the Action, ſent a Horſe-man out to him, to whom <hi>Nara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſus</hi> reply'd, He had ſomething to ſay to the General; but in regard the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:61906:98"/>ſhew'd ſome Diffidence to truſt him, <hi>Narava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> forthwith diſmounts; and giving his Horſe and Arms to his Guard; in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, naked and diſarm'd, with a gallant Boldneſs, adventures into <hi>Hamilcar</hi>'s Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Every body wonder'd at the Bravery of the Man, but receiv'd him amicably, and freely diſcours'd with him; and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> he told him, He wanted not good Inclinations for the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in general; but his Ambition was principally to ingage in a Friendſhip with him, which was the Motive that brought him; which, if he approv'd, he ſhould find him for the future, a faithful Friend, whether it were for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or Action. This Diſcourſe of <hi>Naravaſus,</hi> and the Action it ſelf, perform'd with ſo frank a Boldneſs, fill'd <hi>Barcas</hi> with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Joy, inſomuch, that without the leaſt ſhew of Diſtruſt, he embrac'd the Offer; and not only made him his Confident in his moſt ſecret Negotiations, and his Companion in all his Enterprizes; but to purchaſe his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he promis'd him his Daughter to Wife. And when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Treaty was ended, <hi>Naravaſus</hi> joins <hi>Hamilcar</hi> with a Body of Two Thouſand <hi>Numidians,</hi> with which Re-inforcement he offers the Enemy Battel. <hi>Spendius</hi> likewiſe, on his part, being ſtrengthen'd by the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> marches againſt him, where the Battel was obſtinately fought. The Victory was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61906:98"/>long in ſuſpence, but <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> in the end, had the Day, whoſe Elephants did great Service, and <hi>Naravaſus</hi> ſignaliz'd himſelf above all others. <hi>Spendius</hi> and <hi>Autaritus</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd by Flight, about Ten Thouſand of their Men being ſlain, and Four Thouſand taken Priſoners. After the Battel, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> releas'd all the Priſoners that were willing to take Pay in the Army, and arm'd them with the Spoils of the Dead. As to thoſe that were not willing to ſerve, he aſſembl'd them together, and there told them, That he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pardon'd and Remited their Fault for that time, and gave them their Liberty, leaving every one to his own Courſe; with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, That if ever they were taken in Arms againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they were to expect no Mercy. During theſe Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Mercenaries that were in Gariſon in <hi>Sardinia</hi> mutiny'd likewiſe, after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius;</hi> and having ſhut up <hi>Boſtar</hi> their Commander in chief, in the Citadel, they, at length, murther'd both him and all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> with him. Whereupon the Republick ſent a Re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of more Troops, under the Command of one <hi>Hanno,</hi> whoſe Soldiers likewiſe aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd him on their arrival, and join'd with the Rebels; and at the ſame time ſeiz'd on their Leader, and crucify'd him. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe barbarouſly murther'd all the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> they could find in the Iſland; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61906:99"/>themſelves Maſters of the ſtrong Places, kept them in poſſeſſion, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer'd till a Diſſention happen'd between them and the Natives, who prevailing, chas'd them into <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo that <hi>Sardinia</hi> became by this means, entirely loſt to the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> An Iſland very conſiderable, as well by it's Greatneſs, and the number of the Inhabitants, as for the Fruits and Product of the Country. But in regard many have already largely deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd it, I thought it unneceſſary to ſay more on a Subject ſo well known, it being but ſo much time loſt, to ſay over again what others have ſaid before me.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Matho, Spendius,</hi> and <hi>Autaritus</hi> foreſeeing, that the Clemency which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> exercis'd towards the Priſoners, was like to have but an ill Effect on their Affairs; and fearing leaſt the <hi>Africans,</hi> and their other Troops, in Proſpect of Pardon, ſhould deſert them, and go over to the other Army, they reſolv'd to commit ſome new Act of Villany; ſuch as ſhould put them paſt all hopes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> So they aſſembled all the Army to a certain place, and while they were there, a Meſſenger purpoſely arriv'd with pretended Letters from thoſe who had follow'd their ſteps in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which Letters contain'd ſtrict Injunctions to them, to be careful in guarding <hi>Geſco,</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners (who, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted, were treacherouſly impriſon'd
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61906:99"/>at the Treaty of <hi>Tunes</hi>) inaſmuch as there were ſome in the Army, who had undertaken to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to deliver them up. <hi>Spendius</hi> here takes occaſion to admoniſh them, not to rely on the ſpecious Humanity which <hi>Hamilcar</hi> ſeem'd to ſhow to thoſe who had fallen into his Hands; that it was the leaſt of his Purpoſe to ſpare them, but by a feign'd Clemency, hop'd to draw the reſt to Submiſſion; to the End, that having them once at his Mercy, he might make one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Puniſhment for all; ſhould they be inſnar'd by thoſe Allurements. He further proceeded to Counſel them, to take care not to be out-witted, and, neglecting their Duty, permit <hi>Geſco</hi> to eſcape; who being a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Leader, and in great Authority, would prove one of their moſt dangerous Enemies. <hi>Spendius</hi> had hardly ended his Diſcourſe, when a ſecond Courier arrives, pretending to come from the Camp near <hi>Tunes,</hi> who brings Letters preſſing the ſame matter that was contain'd in the others.</p>
                     <p>Upon this <hi>Autaritus</hi> applies to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to whom he remonſtrates, that their Safety and Succeſs conſiſted purely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all thoſe hopes of Pardon, to which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> labour'd to perſwade them; and that he, whoever he was, that ſhould ſuggeſt any Aſſurance in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Clemency, ſhould forfeit his Fidelity, and was no more to be truſted. He advis'd them,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61906:100"/>therefore, to be guided by, and give credit to thoſe who knew beſt how the <hi>Carthginians</hi> would deal with them, and to hold them for Traitors and Enemies, who ſhould attempt to perſwade the contrary. When he had ended his Diſcourſe, he gave his Opinion that they ought to put <hi>Geſco</hi> to Death; and not only thoſe who were with him, but all ſuch others as had fallen into their Hands ſince the War. This <hi>Autaritus</hi> was a very popular Man in the Army, and prevail'd much in their Aſſemblies; he was, moreover, perfect in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Tongue by reaſon of his long Commerce among them, as were many others under his Command; who, in their common Converſation, ſeldom ſpake in any other Language. This Officer was therefore liſten'd to with general Applauſe, and the Aſſembly was unanimouſly prevail'd with, to conſent to his Propoſition. Howbeit, there were ſome of every Nation, who join'd in their common Requeſt, That, in regard of the many Benefits they had receiv'd at the Hands of <hi>Geſco,</hi> he might have the Favour only to ſuffer Death, without putting him to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in regard their Diſcourſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd and in ſeveral Languages, it was not underſtood what they demanded; and now it being known what was determin'd, one of thoſe there preſent demanded aloud, That they ſhould forthwith execute the Sentence; whereupon immediately all the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61906:100"/>Priſoners that were at hand, were ſton'd to Death, who ſome time after were buried by their Relations, as if they had been kill'd and torn by wild Beaſts. Then <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> order'd <hi>Geſco</hi> to be brought forth out of the Camp, together with the other Priſoners that were with him, to the number of Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Perſons; and being led ſome diſtance off, they firſt cut off their Hands, beginning with <hi>Geſco,</hi> whom juſt before they had own'd for their Benefactor, and whom they had made Choice of to be Umpire of their Differences, then by degrees they Diſmember'd them, and after they had cut off their Legs, they threw them yet alive into a Ditch. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> upon receiving Intelligence of this Savage Piece of Cruelty, juſtly deplor'd the Calamities of thoſe Miſerable People, and ſent to <hi>Hamilcar</hi> and <hi>Hanno,</hi> who was the other General, exhorting them to lay the Diſtreſſes of the Commonwealth to Heart, and to do their utmoſt to revenge the Death of their Fellow-citizens, by the Deſtruction of their Murderers. Heralds were likewiſe diſpatch'd to the Enemy to demand the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Dead, who were ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivering them, that they advis'd them to ſend no more Meſſengers or Ambaſſadours, aſſuring them that the firſt who came ſhould ſhare the Fate of <hi>Geſco.</hi> In a word, they now agreed to Treat all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> that ſhould for the Future fall into their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61906:101"/>Hands, with the like Inhumanity, and ſuch of their Allies as ſhould be taken, they would cut off their Hands, and ſo ſend them back to <hi>Carthage;</hi> which cruel Determination they afterwards rigorouſly executed. Certainly, whoſoever ſhall weigh things rightly, will conclude, that as there are Maladies and Ulcers in Human Bodies, that may arrive to ſuch a head of Malignity as to be paſt all Cure; ſo the Spirits and Minds of Men are obnoxious to the like Diſtempers. In ſhort, there are Sores and Biles in our Bodies which will feſter under the uſe of proper Remedies, and yet if Applications are neglected, they ſpread and prey upon the part affected, and as they grow in Malignity, come at length to conſume the whole Body; not unlike to theſe, there often happens to grow Diſeaſes in the Mind, which arrive at ſuch Inveteracy, that one may with Juſtice conclude, Savage Beaſts themſelves come ſhort of them in Rage and Cruelty. Such as theſe if you treat them with Humanity, grow into greater Jealouſie, and confide in you leſs than before, interpreting your Lenity an effect of Art and Cunning, and become thereby moſt inrag'd with thoſe who diſcover the greateſt Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Clemency. If on the other Hand, you reſent their Barbarities, and pay them in their own Coin, they then make Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Wickedneſs, and there is no Crime or Inhumanity, how impious or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61906:101"/>ſoever, that they will ſcruple at, till at length they ceaſe to be Men, and are Metamorphos'd into Savage Beaſts. And though it cannot be gainſaid, but this Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Mind grows out of ill Manners and bad Education; nevertheleſs, there are other Cauſes that miniſter to the Growth of this Evil, whereof the greateſt are the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Avarice of Magiſtrates and Men in Authority, whereof we have a bloody Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample now before us; the truth of which was made manifeſt as well in the Soldiers as their Officers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hamilcar</hi> greatly provok'd at theſe Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, order'd <hi>Hanno</hi> to join him, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that by uniting all their Troops into one Body, they ſhould ſoon put a Period to the War. And now, contrary to his Cuſtom, he put all of the Enemy to death, who fell into his hands; and if at any time Priſoners were brought into the Army, he ordered them without Mercy to be devoured of wild Beaſts; being at length convinc'd that the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to the Evils under which they ſuffer'd, was, to extend no Compaſſion to the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but, to diminiſh and utterly deſtroy them, by all means poſſible. But, while the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were in theſe fair hopes; when Succeſs every-where attended their Arms, and they had reaſon to expect a favourable Iſſue of the War, behold a Caprice of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who changing Face, turn'd the Tide
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61906:102"/>of their Affairs. The two Generals had no ſooner united their Armies, but they fell at Difference between themſelves, which bred ſuch evil Effects, that by that means, not only many fair Occaſions were loſt of moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemy, but Opportunities given to them, to damnifie the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> which being obſerv'd and weigh'd by the State; one of them was directed to quit his Command; and who ſhould remain in Authority, to be left to the Election of the Army. Another Misfortune, likewiſe, befel them; about that time, a Convoy of theirs coming from a City call'd <hi>Emporium,</hi> wherein they had great Reliance for Supplies, as well of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as other Stores for the Army, was loſt by Tempeſt at Sea. As to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which had ever yielded them great Relief in their ſtraits; that, as we have already noted, was totally loſt. But, to fill the Meaſure of their Adverſity, the two Cities of <hi>Hippona</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> who alone, of all the Towns of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> had, till that time, preſerv'd their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and not only during this War, but in the time of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and even when the <hi>Romans</hi> made their Deſcent on <hi>Africa,</hi> had continu'd faithful, and never manifeſted the leaſt Inclination of Revolt, now abandon'd them; and were not content, barely to take part with the <hi>Africans,</hi> without any apparent Motive, but link'd themſelves, to their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, in a League of faſt Friendſhip and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61906:102"/>Alliance; and grew into mortal Hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> which they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs'd by Murdering five Hundred of their Soldiers, with their Officers, who were ſent to their Relief, after they had receiv'd them into their Towns, and afterwards caſt their dead Bodies over the Walls: In ſhort, thoſe two Places gave themſelves up entirely to the <hi>Africans,</hi> expreſſing ſo great an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that when they ſent Ambaſſadours to them for leave to Bury their Dead, they refus'd them. So that now, <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius,</hi> exalted with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſo much good Fortune, form'd a Deſign of laying Siege to <hi>Carthage</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>During theſe things, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd <hi>Hannibal</hi> to the Army, after they had maturely deliberated about the matter of Difference that had happen'd between the two Generals, and had declar'd it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that <hi>Hanno</hi> ſhould relinquiſh his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Then <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> with <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Naravaſus,</hi> made Inroads into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and cut off all the Enemies means of Suſiſtance, in which Service <hi>Naravaſus</hi> was eminently uſeful, as he did in every thing greatly ſerve them: And this was the State of their Troops that kept the Field.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Carthage</hi> itſelf being block'd up and inclos'd on all ſides, they were driven to have recourſe for Succours
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61906:103"/>to their Friends and Confederates; <hi>Hiero</hi> King of <hi>Siracuſe,</hi> who was their faſt Friend, and having diligently ſuppli'd them with whatever they demanded, during the whole War, gave them now in their greateſt Straits, the beſt Evidence of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and this he wiſely ſaw, to be his ſafeſt Courſe, as conducing to the better Support of his Power in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Alliance with the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> foreſeeing, that if <hi>Carthage</hi> were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in a State to give them Jealouſie, it might be his Lot one Day, to lye at their Mercy, without any Proſpect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
                     <p>Herein, I ſay, <hi>Hiero</hi> did, without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceed like a prudent Prince, it being in no wiſe ſafe, to let a little Miſchief grow to a head; but, to prevent, by all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the exorbitant Increaſe of a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince's Power; leſt, when it ſhall be too late, you find it paſt your Ability to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, when your own proper Intereſt ſhall come to be Conteſted. On the other hand, the <hi>Romans,</hi> purſuant to the Treaty of Peace, were not wanting in any thing to the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> though there ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a Difference between thoſe two States. In brief, the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> at the beginning of this War, had ſeiz'd and made Prize of all Veſſels that traded from <hi>Italy,</hi> to the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> who for Lucre ſuppli'd their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61906:103"/>with whatſoever they wanted. And now having in their Cuſtody at leaſt Five Hundred Priſoners of that Nation, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſtomach'd it, and began to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their Indignation thereat. But, this Point was ſoon compos'd, for as ſoon as they ſignifi'd their Reſentment by their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> reſtor'd the ſaid Priſoners in ſo frank a Manner, that they on their ſide, not to be behind hand in Curteſie, forthwith enlarg'd without Ranſom all the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Priſoners, which yet remain'd of thoſe who had been taken, during the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> War. Furthermore the <hi>Romans</hi> readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted them whatſoever Aſſiſtance they demanded; they permitted their Merchants to ſupply <hi>Carthage,</hi> with every thing they ſtood in need of, and Prohibited all manner of Commerce with their Enemies. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they rejected the Overtures made by the Ambaſſadours of thoſe who had revolted from the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and were in Poſſeſſion of the Iſland, though they offer'd to put it into their hands; and to give far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence of their Sincerity, they refus'd the Tender the People of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> made them, who would have freely given them their City; ſo that the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> thus aided, bore the Hardſhips of the Siege the more chearfully. In the mean time <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius</hi> both beſiege, and are beſieg'd, being reduc'd to ſo great ſtraits for Proviſion, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61906:104"/>all other Stores and Neceſſaries, by the good management of <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> that, in the end, they were conſtrain'd to riſe from before the City, and ſelecting out Fifty Thouſand of the choiceſt Men in their Armies, with whom there join'd a Man of note, call'd <hi>Zarxas,</hi> at the Head of his own People; with which Army they march'd to incounter the Enemy, and obſerve the Motions of <hi>Hamilcar;</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however the Skirts of the Hills, out of fear of the Elephants; and the Horſe of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravaſus,</hi> ſtill uſing their utmoſt Induſtry to keep Poſſeſſion of thoſe Faſtneſſes; and tho' in Courage and Hardineſs they were equal to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> nevertheleſs they were worſted, and came by the loſs in all their Rencounters, as being under worſe Diſcipline, and led by Commanders inferior in Skill and Sufficiency: And it was here demonſtrated, how much the Wiſdom and Knowledge of a great General weighs againſt Strength and Number; for <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> like an Artful Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, firſt draws them in to Pickeer, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in ſmall Parties, and ſo by degrees, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd them; and whenever they came to a Battel, what by his Skill in laying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving Ambuſhes, and otherwiſe, he cut off great numbers of them. Furthermore, he never permitted them to be at reſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd them Night and Day, and ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd it when they leaſt expected it: And ſuch as fell alive into his Hands, he gave to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61906:104"/>be devour'd by wild Beaſts. At length, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing them in a place where they were greatly incommoded, and where he could lie at his eaſe, there he beſieg'd them in their Camp, at a time when they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt ſecure, where he ſo ſtraiten'd them, and brought them to ſuch Extremity, that they came both to want Reſolution to give him Battel, and were without all poſſible means to get out of his Hands; to ſuch Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips were they driven, that they came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another; an Inſtance of the Divine Juſtice, to chaſtiſe the Inhumanity they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had practis'd. They were afraid to come to a Battel, knowing, that whoſoever fell into their Enemies Hands, was ſure to ſuffer Death by the moſt exquiſite Torments; and they deſpair'd of any Terms by Treaty, conſcious of the Guilt of ſo many abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crimes; they therefore determin'd to abide the utmoſt Extremity, and to exerciſe that Cruelty, one among another which they had heretofore practis'd on their Neighbours, and ſo to attend the Arrival of thoſe Succours, which they had been made to hope were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them from <hi>Tunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when they had ſpent all their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with whoſe Bodies they had been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd, and their Slaves were likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſum'd in the like horrid Repaſt; and receiving no News from <hi>Tunes,</hi> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſubdu'd by the Sharpneſs of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61906:105"/>beginning to look with an angry Eye on their Leaders; <hi>Spendius, Autaritas,</hi> and <hi>Zarxas</hi> began to form Deſigns of yielding themſelves up, and ſo to enter upon Treaty with <hi>Hamilcar;</hi> whereupon, demanding, by a Trumpet, a Paſsport for Perſons to be ſent on a Treaty, they themſelves, among others, went and put themſelves into the Hands of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to whom <hi>Hamilcar</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the following Conditions: <hi>That the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>ſhould make choice of Ten Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of the Enemies Army, of what Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever, and that the rest of the Army ſhould be diſarm'd, and diſmiſs'd in their Shirts.</hi> Theſe Conditions being agreed to, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> then declar'd, That, purſuant to the Articles of Agreement, he made choice of thoſe there preſent; ſo the Number was compos'd of <hi>Autaritas, Spendius,</hi> and the reſt of their chief Officers. But when the Army was given to underſtand, that their Commanders were detain'd, knowing nothing of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was accorded between them, they took for granted, they had been betray'd. Whereupon, in a tumultuous manner, they ran to their Arms. But <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand with them, drew out his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and with them, and the reſt of the Army ſurrounding them, fell upon them, and cut them in pieces, to the number of Forty Thouſand. The place where this bloody Service was perform'd, was call'd <hi>Prion,</hi>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:61906:105"/>which ſignifieth a Saw; foraſmuch as it bore reſemblance to that kind of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>After this famous Defeat of their Enemies, the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who were driven almoſt to Deſpair, began to take Heart, while <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar,</hi> with <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Naravaſus</hi> forrag'd and ſcour'd the Country; and the News of the Victory being diſpers'd, diſpos'd many of the <hi>Africans</hi> to come into the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army; and moſt of the Towns round about to return to their Obedience. After this, they take their March towards <hi>Tunes,</hi> where they beſieg'd <hi>Matho. Hannibal</hi>'s Quarter was on that part that regards <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>'s on the oppoſite ſide; As ſoon as their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was incamp'd, they led out <hi>Spendius</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners; and bringing them near the Walls of the Town, they there cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd them in view of the Enemy. But <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> having obſerv'd, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> did not keep ſo good a Guard in his Camp as he ought, ſally'd out, and attack'd his Quarters; where killing many of his People, he put the reſt to flight, pillag'd his Camp; and taking <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf Priſoner, forthwith order'd <hi>Spendius</hi> to be taken from the Croſs, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> to be ſix'd alive in his place, where he executed him with unſpeakable Torments; then they choſe out Thirty <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, of the Nobleſt they could find; and placing them about the Body of <hi>Spendius,</hi> put
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61906:106"/>them to death; as if Fortune had made a Compact with theſe two People, to give them Occaſions of thus mutually exerciſing their Cruelty one on the other. <hi>Hamilcar</hi>'s Poſt was ſo remote from <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s, that the matter was paſt remedy, before he knew any thing of it; and tho' he ſhould have receiv'd earlier Notice, the Difficulty of the Ground and Situation of the Place would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him but little hopes to relieve them. Whereupon he decamp'd from where he was, and came and poſted himſelf along the Sea-ſide, near the Mouth of the River <hi>Macheta.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> affrighted at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd for Loſs, began to fall from their late Hopes; nevertheleſs, they omitted nothing that might evidence their Care for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Wherefore they diſpatch'd Thirty of the Body of their Senate, together with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> who had already commanded in this War, to <hi>Hamilcar;</hi> furthermore, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd him with a Re-inforcement to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with all they could pick up, that could bear Arms in the City. The Senators were inſtructed, above all things, to labour an Accomodation between <hi>Hamilcar</hi> and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and to diſpoſe them to ſuch an Accord, that the Commonwealth might not be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie'd to their Differences. Whereupon, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together, after long Conference and Debate, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> and <hi>Hanno,</hi> became Friends,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61906:106"/>and paſs'd their Words to agree in all things for the common Good; and accordingly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, their Affairs were ſucceſsfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, to the full Satisfaction of their Fellow-citizens. So that <hi>Matho</hi> was now often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Deſpair; ſometimes by Ambuſhes, ſometimes by Surprizes, which frequently happen'd, as on an occaſion near <hi>Leptis,</hi> and others; where in all Parties and Rencounters they ſtill came by the worſt. At length, they determin'd to come to a Battel, to which the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> on their part, willingly agreed: The Friends and Confederates of of both Parties were drawn together; and their Garriſons were drawn out to augment their Armies, for deciding the Diſpute; and when all things were in a readineſs, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was fought on the Day appointed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had the Day, and the greateſt part, of the <hi>African</hi> Army ſlain on the place; ſome few that eſcap'd, got into a neighbouring Town, which ſoon ſubmitted, where <hi>Matho</hi> was taken alive. Upon this Succeſs, all the Towns in <hi>Africa,</hi> that had been under the Dominion of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> return'd to their Obedience, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> and <hi>Hippona</hi> only excepted, which continu'd in their Obſtinacy; who being, indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of Favour, had no ground to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; for from the firſt of their Defection, they acted againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> ſo as to cut off all proſpect of Pardon; which may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61906:107"/>ſerve for Inſtruction, how neceſſary it proves, even in thoſe ſort of Crimes whereof we have been treating, to leave ſome place for Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not to act beyond the power of Reparation. In ſhort, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> ſetting down before thoſe two Towns, reduc'd them, at length, to Mercy. And ſo ended the War of <hi>Africk,</hi> which had brought the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> State in ſo much Danger: And now they ſaw their Dominion reſtor'd, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Rebellion puniſh'd. <hi>Matho,</hi> and thoſe taken with him, after they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in Triumph about the City, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all kind of Ignominy, and us'd in the cruelleſt manner that could be invented, were, at length, tormented to Death. This War laſted three Years, and near four Months, and contain'd more Acts of Cruelty, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, than are to be found any where elſe in Story.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time the <hi>Romans</hi> being ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by the Mercenaries, who were beaten out of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and were fled to them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to attempt the Poſſeſſion of that great Iſland; but the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having the Right of firſt Poſſeſſion, would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Injury; and in regard they were now preparing an Army to go over and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Infidelity of thoſe Iſlanders; the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> interpreting thoſe Preparations to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, took thence Occaſion to declare a new War on them. But the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:61906:107"/>who had but juſt laid down their Arms, and knew themſelves to be much too weak, and no ways in a condition to wage War with them, found it their beſt courſe to ſubmit; and did not only yield up their Right to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but bought their Peace at the price of Twelve Hundred Talents.</p>

                     <p>WE have ſhown in our former Book, at what Time it was that the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd on Forreign Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after they had compos'd their Affairs in <hi>Italy.</hi> We have related the Motives and Manner of their Tranſporting their Arms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and upon what Grounds they made War on the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and contended with them for the Dominion of that Iſland
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61906:109"/>We have alſo noted the Time when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> firſt ingag'd on Naval Action, and what occur'd during the Progreſs of the War, till the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> totally relinquiſh'd their Pretenſions to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and their Enemies became Maſters of it; all but what was reſerv'd to King <hi>Hiero.</hi> Then we came to relate the Tranſactions of the War, made by the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Mercinaries on their Maſters, which was call'd the War of <hi>Africk.</hi> We have likewiſe, in that Account, given Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the utmoſt Degrees of the Barbarity of Human Nature, and told what was the Iſſue of ſo many Savage Actions, purſuing the Story to the end of that War, wherein the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> remain'd with Victory.</p>
                     <p>Now we ſhall proceed, according to our firſt Purpoſe, to ſet down ſubſequent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences; For, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had no ſooner compos'd their <hi>African</hi> Troubles, when they rais'd a new Army, the Command when which was given to <hi>Hamilcar Barcas,</hi> with Direction to tranſport it into <hi>Spain,</hi> who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Son <hi>Hannibal</hi> with him, not then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nine Years old, croſs'd the Sea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where near the Strait of <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars, and began to lay the Foundation of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Greatneſs in <hi>Spain.</hi> Where, after he had commanded, for the Space of almoſt nine Years, and brought many Nations to yield Obedience to that Government; ſubduing ſome by Force, and wining others by Addreſs;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61906:109"/>he at length ended his Days, in a manner worthy of the Greatneſs of his Name, being ſlain in Battel, bravely Fighting at the head of his Troops, againſt a formidable Enemy, that oppos'd him. Upon whoſe Death the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> gave his Command to <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> his Kinſman, at that time General of their Gallies.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, the <hi>Romans</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported an Army, and made their firſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>Illyria</hi> and the Parts adjacent. So that, whoſoever would curiouſly Search into the Hiſtory of the Growth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs, is to have ſpecial Regard to that Part of their Story.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes moving to this Expedition, ſeem to be theſe: <hi>Agro,</hi> at that time King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> Son of <hi>Pleuratus,</hi> ſurpaſs'd by much all his Predeceſſors in Power and Greatneſs, both by Sea and Land. He had promis'd <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> Father of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who had gain'd him with a Sum of Mony, to ſend Succours to the <hi>Mydionians,</hi> whom the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> at that time had beſieg'd, mov'd it ſeems thereunto, for that they refus'd to joyn with them, to live under the ſame Laws, whom they therefore had determin'd to Reduce by Arms. And having levy'd an Army from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that People, they declar'd War againſt thoſe of <hi>Mydionia,</hi> whoſe City they greatly diſtreſs'd: attacking it with Machins and Engines of all ſorts. During this Siege the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61906:110"/>time drew near wherein the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were oblig'd to chuſe a new Praetor; but foraſmuch as the Beſieg'd were now brought to Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and that there were hopes they wou'd ſoon Capitulate; the preſent Praetor, who then commanded the Army, remonſtrated to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> that in regard he had born the Toyl and Hazzard of the Siege, it ſeem'd but juſt, that he might be permitted to enjoy the Benefit of Diſpoſing of the Booty, and the Honour of Taking the Place. But this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition found Oppoſers, eſpecially among thoſe who were Candidates in the new Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who perſwaded the People by no means to conſent to any Innovation in their Cuſtoms, but to manage their Affairs according to the Preſcription of their Laws, and leave the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to Fortune. Whereupon, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> reſolved to proceed to the Election; allotting however, the Profit and Honour that was to be won, to be divided between him that now commanded, and the other who ſhould be choſen.</p>
                     <p>Three Days after this Determination, was to be the Election, when the new Officer was immediately to enter on his Charge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtom; but in the interim, there arrives a Fleet of a hundred ſmall Veſſels with a Re-inforcement of five Thouſand <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrians,</hi> who at break of Day landed ſecretly near the Town, and immediately put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Order of Battel, according to their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61906:110"/>manner; and being form'd in ſeveral Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they advanc'd towards the <hi>Aetolians</hi> Camp, who were much ſurpriz'd at the Hardineſs of this ſudden Attempt; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they loſt nothing of their uſual Aſſurance, and the Pride that is become habitual to that Nation; for they rely'd on their Courage, and preſum'd their Army was not to be beaten. They having many Troops heavy arm'd, and abounding in Horſe, theſe they commanded to March out, and imbattel'd them in plain ground before their Camp. They likewiſe order'd their light arm'd Troops, and ſome Horſe, to take Poſſeſſion of certain advantageous Poſts, and to ſeize on ſuch Eminencies, as were not too remote from the Camp. And now the <hi>Illyrians</hi> advancing upon the light arm'd Troops, ſoon beat them from their Ground, as being more in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and marching in cloſe Order. Then they forc'd the Horſe likewiſe to retire, and winning the advantage of Ground, they charg'd thoſe who were drawn up in the Plain; by which means they were the more eaſily routed; the Beſieg'd likewiſe, at the ſame time made a Sally, and between them, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were at length defeated; many were ſlain on the Place, and many taken Priſoners, with great ſtore of Arms, and all their Baggage. Thus, as ſoon as the <hi>Illyrians</hi> had executed their Maſters Orders, and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Veſſels with Booty, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61906:111"/>embark'd again, and made Sail back to their Country.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mydionians</hi> finding themſelves thus happily reſcu'd, when they diſpair'd of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, call'd an Aſſembly of their Magiſtrates to conſult of their Affairs, and principally to determine of the Diſpoſal of the Booty; where 'twas agreed, that the preſent Praetor, and he who was in Election for the enſuing Year, ſhould joyntly have the Authority in the Diſtribution thereof.</p>
                     <p>This Adventure of the <hi>Mydionians,</hi> is a ſort of Leſſon to the reſt of Mankind, where Fortune ſeems by a ſingular Inſtance to put us in mind of her All-ſufficiency; for when they thought themſelves ruin'd paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſhe then puts an occaſion in their hands whereby to deal to their Enemies the ſelf ſame Meaſure, which they had decreed for them.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who were thus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd and defeated; their Misfortune may inſtruct us, not over-boldly to determine of Events, and to let Doubt have a ſhare in all our Adventures, while there is a Poſſibility, that things may fall out otherwiſe than we expect. For, it behoves us in all the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of our Life, eſpecially in Military Matters, to remember, that we are at beſt but Men, whoſe wiſeſt Counſels can never ſuffice to obviate the Fatality of ſuch ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Stroaks.</p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:61906:111"/>
                     <p>Upon the return home of King <hi>Agro</hi>'s Fleet which he had diſpatch'd on this Expediton, he fell into ſuch a Fit of Joy at the Report his Captains made him of the Succeſs of the Battel, and their having vanquiſht the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> a People held in great Eſteem for their Valour; that falling into great Exceſs of Drinking and Revelling, to Celebrate the Victory, he was ſeiz'd by a Pleureſie, which ſoon put an end to his Days. After him <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> his Wife reign'd, and was govern'd by the Counſels of ſuch Friends, as ſhe had about her. But the Queen, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her Sex, amus'd with the Joy of her preſent Proſperity, took no Thought for the future, and without any regard of Danger that might befal her from abroad; Firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits her Subjects to practiſe Piracy, who made Prize of all they met with at Sea; then ſhe ſitted out a Fleet equal to that we have mention'd, with Command to the Leaders, to Treat all Nations as Enemies. Their firſt Enterprize was on the <hi>Eleans,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Meſſene,</hi> who ſtood moſt expos'd to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the <hi>Illyrians:</hi> For that Country lying along the Sea-coaſt, and their Towns ſtanding but thin, it was the more liable to their Attempts, it being hard to ſend at any time ſeaſonable Relief whereſoever they ſhould be invaded, by reaſon of the remoteneſs of their Succours: So that the <hi>Illyrians</hi> ravag'd all that Country with Impunity. From
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61906:112"/>thence they ſteer'd towards <hi>Phoenice,</hi> a City of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> whether they went to Revictual their Fleet, when coming to Anchor in the Port, they there entred into Treaty with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gauls,</hi> who compos'd part of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to betray the Town into their Hands, there being no leſs than eight Hundred of that Nation then in Pay in the City. The <hi>Gauls</hi> agree to their Propoſal, whereupon they landed their Forces, and were receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, plundring them of all they had, aſſiſted in their Attempt by the ſaid <hi>Gauls,</hi> then in Garriſon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Epirots,</hi> upon receiving Intelligence of what had hapen'd, march'd forthwith to the Relief of the Place, and coming within a little diſtance of <hi>Phoenice</hi> they incamp'd their Army, which they did in ſuch manner, that the River which runs through the Town, ſerv'd for a kind of Retrenchment; and for their better Security, they took away the Timber of the Bridge, that gave paſſage over the ſaid River. But receiving Intelligence, that <hi>Scerdilaidus</hi> was coming by Land, at the Head of five Thouſand <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs by the Straits of <hi>Antigonia,</hi> they thereupon detach'd a part of their Army thither, to ſecure that Place, while the other part lay idle in the Camp, careleſs of their Duty, and negligent of their Guard; ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their time in Riot and Feaſting, toward which the Country (abounding) plentifully
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61906:112"/>ſupply'd them; but for the Military Part, they ſet little by it, as holding that Profeſſion in a ſort of Contempt. Inſomuch, that when the <hi>Illyrians</hi> got notice of this their Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and that they had divided their Army, they march'd away in the Night, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Bridge, boldly paſs'd over the River, and preſently poſſeſs'd themſelves of a ſecure piece of Ground, and there paſs'd the reſt of the Night, and in the Morning, by break of Day both Armies drew up in Battalia, where they fought in ſight of the Town, in which Diſpute the <hi>Epyrots</hi> were beaten; many were ſlain upon the place, and taken Priſoners, and the reſt eſcap'd by taking the way towards the <hi>Antitanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this Defeat, the <hi>Epyrots</hi> diſpairing of better Fortune, ſent their Ambaſſadours to the <hi>Aetolians</hi> and the <hi>Achaians,</hi> to ſollicit Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, who in Compaſſion of their Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, readily accorded them a Supply; and purſuant to their Promiſe, ſhortly after brought their Forces to <hi>Helicranus,</hi> in order to their Relief. The <hi>Illyrians,</hi> who were poſſeſs'd of <hi>Phoenice,</hi> advanc'd towards that Place likewiſe, in Conjunction with <hi>Scerdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laidus,</hi> and incamp'd not far from the Enemy, with Intention to give them Battel, but the inconveniency of the Ground prevented them. During theſe Tranſactions there came Letters from the Queen, containing Orders for their ſpeedy return Home, to aſſiſt her againſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61906:113"/>of her revolted Subjects, who had join'd with the <hi>Dardanians.</hi> So, after they had ſpoil'd and plunder'd the <hi>Epyrots,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a Ceſſation of Arms; and, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the Treaty, deliver'd back their Town and all the Inhabitants of free Condition that were in their Poſſeſſion. But they embark'd, and carry'd away their Slaves and the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <hi>Scerdilaidus</hi> returning by the Straits of <hi>Antigonia.</hi> Theſe Attempts greatly alarm'd all the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities upon the Coaſt; for when they conſider'd, that ſo ſtrong and important a Town of the <hi>Epyrots</hi> had been taken, ſo contrary to the Opinion of all the World; they began to take thought, every one for themſelves, and were not now only in pain for the Country, but for their Towns and Cities. And now, who would not have thought, that the <hi>Epyrots</hi> ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, how to be reveng'd for theſe Injuries, and to render Marks of their Gratitude to thoſe who ſo readily ſuccour'd them! but ſo it happen'd, that they did neither, But diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, forthwith, their Ambaſſadours to Queen <hi>Teuta,</hi> and enter'd into Confederacy with the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> inſomuch that they never after quitted their League with them, and continu'd in perpetual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians;</hi> by which Act, they gave at once manifeſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their Ingratitude and Imprudence.</p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61906:113"/>
                     <p>Whoſoever fall into Misfortunes, which Human Reaſon or Foreſight could not obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, no Man can juſtly charge them with the Evil that they ſuffer, but attribute it meerly to Fortune, and thoſe who are the cauſe. On the other hand, when Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties befal us, through our own Imprudence, we muſt be content to bear the blame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis, that when we behold a miſerable Man, made ſo, purely by the Malignity of Fortune, we cannot with-hold our Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and are ſo far from condemning him, that we miniſter to his Relief. But when our Miſeries are the Fruit of our Folly and Obſtinacy, we become juſtly the Reproach and Contempt of every wiſe Man. Now, who, that had ever heard of the Inconſtancy and notorious Perfidy of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> would have depoſited ſo important a Place in their keeping, where ſo many occaſions were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to occur to tempt their Fidelity! Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, who would not eſpecially have held that People in Suſpicion, that were known to have been expell'd their Country, for their Breach of Faith towards their own Nation? Who, after being taken into the Service of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> where, on a Rumour, that their Mercenaries were likely to Mutiny for want to Pay, three Thouſand of them that were in Garriſon at <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> revolted and plunder'd the City; and afterwards being put into <hi>Erix,</hi> while the <hi>Romans</hi> laid Siege
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61906:114"/>to that Place, attempted to betray it to the Enemy, and on diſcovery of their Treachery, deſerted the Service and went over to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſoon after rifl'd the Temple of <hi>Venus Ericina:</hi> So that, at length, what for their Impiety, what for their Treachery, the <hi>Romans</hi> thought they could not do a more meritorious Act, than totally to expel them <hi>Italy;</hi> and, in a word, the Peace was no ſooner concluded betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when, diſarming them, they caus'd them to be embark'd, and baniſh'd them entirely out of their Dominions. After what hath been obſerv'd, then, who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear blaming the <hi>Epyrots</hi> for giving up their Country, their Laws, and ſo rich, happy, and plentiful a City to the Cuſtody of ſuch a perfidious Nation? What Apology can be offer'd in their Defence, and who will not be oblig'd to confeſs, they were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Authors of their own Calamities? This Reflection we thought was not amiſs to make, touching the Imprudence of the <hi>Epyrots;</hi> to the end, we may be inſtructed in the Danger of committing the ſafety of a Town to Strangers, whoſe ſtrength is ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to that of the Natives within it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Illyrians,</hi> during their abode at <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> continu'd their Cuſtom of Piracy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over, and pillaging all ſuch as traded from the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> where they plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd certain <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants; kill'd ſome,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61906:114"/>and carried others away Priſoners. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had hit herto neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Complaints that had been made of theſe Outrages, being now alarm'd with new Clamours, coming from ſundry Places at once, to the Senate, diſpatch'd their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to <hi>Illyria, Cajus</hi> and <hi>Lucius Corun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> to be rightly inform'd touching the Truth of theſe Reports. In the mean time, Queen <hi>Teuta</hi> beholding her Veſſels on their return from <hi>Epyrus,</hi> loaden with ſo much rich Booty (for <hi>Phoenice</hi> ſurpaſs'd all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that Kingdom in Wealth and Beauty) became greatly exalted and incourag'd by this extraordinary Succeſs, and thereby the more ſtrongly incited to enter into a War with the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Nevertheleſs it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpited for the preſent, in regard of ſome Troubles at that time in her own Kingdom, which were no ſooner compos'd, when ſhe laid Siege to the City of <hi>Iſſa,</hi> which alone had refus'd to yield her Obedience: About which time it was, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours arriv'd; who being admitted to their Audience, ſet forth the Injuries that had been done. During their Diſcourſe, <hi>Teuta</hi> treating them with great Pride and Diſdain; in ſhort, told them, She would take Care for the future, that no publick Injuries ſhould be done to the People of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> but that it was not the Cuſtom of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to forbid their Subjects to make their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61906:115"/>Profits of what they met with in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Sea. The younger of the Ambaſſadours ſtomaching this Anſwer of the Queen's, with an Aſſurance truly worthy of a <hi>Roman,</hi> but at that time, perhaps, not ſo ſeaſonable, thus reply'd, <hi>It is likewiſe, Madam, the Cuſtom of the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>to make themſelves pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reparations for Injuries done in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and to yield Succour to thoſe that receive them: We ſhall therefore apply ourſelves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our own Wrongs, wherein we ſhall proceed in ſuch a manner, that you will be ſoon oblig'd to change that Princely Cuſtom. Teuta</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Woman of a fierce Spirit, heard theſe Words with ſo much Indignation, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the Right of Nations, as ſoon as they departed, ſhe order'd the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, who had us'd this Liberty of Speech, to be murther'd. The News of which Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, acted by this haughty Woman, was no ſooner come to <hi>Rome,</hi> when they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately prepar'd for War, and fell to raiſing of Troops and fitting out a Fleet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teuta,</hi> early the following Spring, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd another Fleet againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> more numerous than the former; one Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron whereof ſail'd towards <hi>Corfu,</hi> another towards <hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi> under colour of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves with Victual and Water, but with deſign to ſurpriſe the Town. The Inhabitants, on their arrival, ſuſpecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, imprudently admitted ſome of them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61906:115"/>into the Town, under pretence of fetching Water: Theſe having Arms conceal'd in their Water-veſſels, were no ſooner entred, when killing the Guards, they became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Gate. In the mean time, as it had been concerted between them, thoſe who remain'd in the Ships, came to aſſiſt them; ſo that by this Reinforcement, they were quickly Maſters of the greateſt part of their Works. And now, albeit the Inhabitants were but ill provided for ſuch a Rencounter, and greatly aſtoniſh'd at ſo ſurpriſing an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nevertheleſs, recovering Courage, and ſtanding on their Defence, they manfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the <hi>Illyrians;</hi> who, after a long Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, were compell'd to retire. So the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi> who were on the point of loſing their Town thro' their Negligence, preſerv'd it by their Reſolution; and the Danger into which they were like to fall became a Warning to them for the time to come. The <hi>Illyrians</hi> hereupon put to Sea, and joyning with the other Squadron that was gone before, ſtood towards <hi>Corfu,</hi> where they landed, and ſat down before the Town, filling all the Country with Terrour and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of <hi>Corfu</hi> being thus ſurpris'd, and driven almoſt to the point of Deſpair, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, with all expedition, Ambaſſadours to the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> arriving at the ſame time
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61906:116"/>to implore Succors, and beſeech them not to permit the <hi>Illyrians</hi> to drive them out of their Country. They were favourably heard by thoſe two People, who agreed together to diſpatch ten <hi>Achaian</hi> Ships, well mann'd, and provided with all things neceſſary; and when they were ready, they made Sail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Corfu,</hi> in hopes to be able to raiſe the Siege. But the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> having, according to their Treaty, receiv'd a Re-inforcement of ten Gallies of the <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> were got a-head of the Enemy, and engag'd them near <hi>Paxus.</hi> The <hi>Achaian</hi> Veſſels that fought the <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> made it but a kind of a drawn Buſineſs, ſeparating with little Harm done on either ſide, only ſome few Soldiers hurt. But it far'd otherwiſe with thoſe who fought the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> who faſtning themſelves four and four together, proceeded after ſuch a manner, as (ſeeming to be intangled) they might, by expoſing their Broad-ſides, tempt the Enemy to attack them in Flank, who, when they had boarded them, they by that Device over-pow'ring them with Numbers from the adjoyning Veſſels, enter'd on the Decks of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Gallies, and eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them, taking four, and ſinking one, with all her Men a-board; in which Veſſel, was <hi>Marcus Carenias,</hi> a Man of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, who had all his Life long ſerv'd the <hi>Achaians</hi> with much Honour and Integrity. When thoſe who were engag'd with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnanians,</hi>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61906:116"/>ſaw the <hi>Illyrians</hi> had the better of the Battel, they retir'd from the Fight, wherein they were greatly further'd by the nimbleneſs and good-built of their Gallies, and ſo made the beſt of their way Home.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Victory, the Inſolence of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> grew greater and greater, who now ſtraiten'd the Town more than before; ſo that, at length, after ſome time of Defence, being depriv'd of all hope of Succour, they yielded it up, receiving an <hi>Illyrian</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Pharos</hi> for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. After this Action, the <hi>Illyrians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> and laid Siege to that Place.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls, <hi>Cajus Fulvius,</hi> with a Navy of two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sail, and <hi>Aulus Poſthumius</hi> with a Land-army, ſet forth on their Expedition. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> arriving at <hi>Corfu,</hi> was in hopes to find the Siege yet a-foot; and tho' he found the Town was ſurrender'd, and the <hi>Illyrians</hi> in Garriſon, he reſolv'd, however, to attempt ſomething, as well to be ſatisfy'd how Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs had been carry'd, as to endeavour after ſome Intelligence with <hi>Demetrius;</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, That he was fallen into the Queen's Diſpleaſure, and had ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make a Tender of the Garriſon to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, thoſe of <hi>Corfu,</hi> glad of the Arrival of the <hi>Romans,</hi> put themſelves (by Conſent of <hi>Demetrius</hi>) into their Protection, hoping they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61906:117"/>ſhould thereby be ſafe for the future, againſt the Outrages of the <hi>Illyrians.</hi> So ſoon as things were adjuſted here, the <hi>Romans</hi> made Sail for <hi>Apollonia,</hi> having <hi>Demetrius</hi> for their Pilot. In the mean time, <hi>Poſthumius</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd his Land-army at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of about twenty Thouſand Foot, and two Thouſand Horſe, who join'd the Fleet at <hi>Apollonia;</hi> which Town being put into their Hands, they departed for <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> on Intelligence that the <hi>Illyrians</hi> had beſieg'd that Place; who having notice of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> approach, rais'd their Siege, and ſled, ſcattering for ſafety as well as they could; ſo that that Town being likewiſe taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Romans</hi> Protection, they advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Illyria,</hi> ſubduing the <hi>Ardyans</hi> in their way. And now Ambaſſadours came to the <hi>Romans</hi> from divers Countries, among which, thoſe of the <hi>Parthenians</hi> and the <hi>Antitanes;</hi> theſe offering to put themſelves under the <hi>Roman</hi> Protection, were admitted to their Alliance. So they paſs'd on to <hi>Iſſa,</hi> which the <hi>Illyrians</hi> had likewiſe beſieg'd, but departed at the approach of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom the Inhabitants deliver'd up the City. Afterwards, coaſting along the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Shore, they aſſaulted and took ſeveral of their Towns, among which, <hi>Nutria,</hi> where they loſt their Quaeſtor, ſome Tribunes, and many Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but this Loſs was repair'd, by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Forty of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> Veſſels, which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61906:117"/>were returning home loaden with Booty. As for thoſe who had beſieg'd <hi>Iſſa,</hi> among whom were a Body of <hi>Pharians;</hi> theſe were well treated by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and continu'd in his Service; the reſt being ſcatter'd made their eſcape to <hi>Arbon. Teuta,</hi> hereupon, with a ſmall retinue, retir'd to a ſtrong Place call'd <hi>Rizon,</hi> ſituate a good Diſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Country, on a River of that Name. And now, the <hi>Romans</hi> having put the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the <hi>Illyrian</hi> State into the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and after having inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with great Authority, they return'd with both their Armies to <hi>Dyrrachium;</hi> from thence <hi>Cajus Fulvius</hi> departed towards <hi>Rome,</hi> with the major Part of both Armies; but <hi>Poſthumius</hi> remain'd behind with forty long Veſſels, and rais'd an Army from among the Natives, to the end, if there ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he might be in a poſture of Defence; for they were not ſure of the Fidelity of the <hi>Ardyans</hi> and others, who had put themſelves under the <hi>Roman</hi> Protection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teuta,</hi> early the following Spring ſent Ambaſſadours to <hi>Rome,</hi> with whom ſhe made her Peace on the following Conditions, <hi>That ſhe ſhould be Tributary to the</hi> Romans, <hi>paying ſuch a yearly Sum as they ſhould think fit to impoſe: That ſhe ſhould relinquiſh, entirely, her Interest in</hi> Illyria, <hi>ſaving ſome few Places.</hi> And what was yet more conſiderable, and wherein the <hi>Greeks</hi> were principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61906:118"/>
                        <hi>ſhe was not to Navigate beyond</hi> Liſſus <hi>with above two Veſſels, and thoſe unarm'd.</hi> After this, <hi>Poſthumius</hi> ſent Ambaſſadours to the <hi>Aetolians</hi> and <hi>Achaians,</hi> firſt to report to them the true Cauſe and Motives of the War, which brought the <hi>Romans</hi> into theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and then to give them an Account of the Succeſs of their Arms; cauſing the Treaty of Accord made between them and the <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to be publickly read: The Ambaſſadours having been receiv'd with due Honour, and entertain'd with all manner of Reſpect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Corfu;</hi> and by the Peace now made with the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> were deliver'd from their Fears. For in thoſe Dais, the <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made no fair War with any particular People, but rob'd and pillag'd all Nations they met with. Theſe then were the Motives the <hi>Romans</hi> had firſt of carrying their Arms into <hi>Illyria,</hi> and thoſe Countries of <hi>Europe;</hi> and then was the firſt Intercourſe they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by their Ambaſſadours, with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Greece.</hi> Afterwards they ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> and then it was that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ordain'd, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have part in the <hi>Iſthmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Games.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things were tranſacted in thoſe Parts by the <hi>Romans, Aſdrubal</hi> (for we were ſpeaking of him, when we broke off our Diſcourſe about <hi>Spain</hi>) govern'd his Province with great Wiſdom and Addreſs,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61906:118"/>performing infinite Services of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Power eſpecially by a City he caus'd to be built, which is call'd by ſome <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> by others, the <hi>New Town.</hi> This City hath a very commodious Situation, whether we reſpect either <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Africk;</hi> but we ſhall have occaſion elſe-where to ſpeak more particularly thereof, and the Benefit accruing thereby to both thoſe Countries. When the <hi>Romans</hi> came to underſtand, that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> had acquir'd ſo great a Reputation in that Country, as to become formidable to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they reſolv'd to attempt ſomething likewiſe on that ſide; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that the Growth of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Greatneſs was principally owing to their Negligence, who, by a profound Careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had, as it were, ſlept away their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; they therefore determin'd to repair that Error, by their future Care and Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. They did not dare, however, for the preſent, to exact any thing of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that might appear hard and ſevere; nor declare a War with them, from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions they were under of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who at that time (as it was bruited) were preparing an Army to march againſt <hi>Rome.</hi> They reſolv'd, therefore, for the preſent, to ſooth and amuſe <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> by Art, that they might have the more leiſure to deal with the <hi>Gauls.</hi> For they rightly judg'd, that while
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61906:119"/>they ſhould have that Enemy at their backs, it would be not only impoſſible for them to become entire Maſters of <hi>Italy,</hi> but their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty itſelf would not be out of Danger. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after they had concluded a Treaty with <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> by their Ambaſſadours, by which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were oblig'd not to advance their Arms beyond the River <hi>Eber,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making mention of any other Countries of <hi>Spain,</hi> they prepar'd to attack the <hi>Gauls</hi> that inhabited <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before we come to ſpeak of that War, we have thought it not improper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nation of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whereby to Conduct the Reader to a right Knowledge of thoſe Matters which we purpoſe to deliver. It will alſo beget a better Connexion of the Parts of our Hiſtory, to ſhew the Time when that People firſt planted themſelves in <hi>Italy.</hi> In ſhort, we have not only judg'd their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worthy Recording, and that they ought to be deliver'd to Poſterity, but have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it neceſſary to our Purpoſe ſo to do. For, we ſhall learn by that means what ſort of People it was that ſerv'd under <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and with what kind of Aids he ſuſtain'd his great Deſign of Subverting the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>But it ſeems fit firſt, to make mention of the Country, to the end that by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Nature and Situation of their Towns, we may give a clearer Inſight into the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61906:119"/>principal Parts of our Hiſtory. <hi>Italy</hi> then is in Form of a Triangle; that part which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Eaſt, is terminated by the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, and <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulf: The Weſtern and Southern Parts are bounded by the <hi>Tuſcane</hi> and <hi>Sicilian</hi> Seas; and where theſe two Lines meet is one Part of the Triangle, here is a Promontory looking towards the South, which is call'd <hi>Cothinthus,</hi> which ſeparates the <hi>Sicilian</hi> and <hi>Ionian</hi> Seas. The part which regards the North, and joins it to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, is bounded by the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which take their beginning about <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bordering on the <hi>Sardinian</hi> Sea, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and extending from thence to the bottom of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulf; if they do not reach quite as far as <hi>Adria</hi> beneath theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which Line makes the Baſe of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle; there are ſpacious and fertile Plains ranging North and South, which terminate the Continent of <hi>Italy.</hi> Theſe Plains which have likewiſe a triangular Form, (whereof the joining of the <hi>Alpes</hi> and <hi>Appennine</hi> Hills near <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> make one Point) exceed in Fertility all other Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> On the North they are bounded by the <hi>Alpes,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending above two hundred and ſixty Miles in length; but the Bounds thereof towards the South, are made by the <hi>Appennines,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in length about four hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles; towards the Sea, where the Coaſt of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> made another ſide of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61906:120"/>Triangle, is computed from <hi>Senagallia</hi> to the bottom of the Gulf, in length about three hundred Miles. So that this Plain or Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign Country contains in Circuit, little leſs than eleven hundred Miles.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the Fertility of <hi>Italy,</hi> it is hardly poſſible to ſet it forth: It abounds ſo much in Bread-corn, that very often, and even in our Days, the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Buſhel of Wheat hath been ſold for four <hi>Oboli,</hi> and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at two, and a Metreta of Wine at the ſame price: They have Plenty likewiſe of Millet and all other Grain, beyond expreſſion. It may be judg'd alſo that they abound in Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, inſomuch as the <hi>Italians</hi> breed infinite numbers of Swine, which are ſpent in their Sacrifices, and common Uſes, and carry'd in Heards with their Armies. In a word, it will be ſeen, by what follows, how plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully this Country is ſtor'd with all things neceſſary to Human Life, thoſe who travel in theſe parts, never cheapen any thing in their Inn, but demand only how much they are to pay by the Head; where you ſhall be very well treated for a quarter of an <hi>Obo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> and it is ſeldom, or never, that they demand more. Their People are numerous, their Men proper and well-propotion'd; and by their Actions, they make appear, that they are no leſs qualify'd for War. The <hi>Gauls,</hi> who are call'd <hi>Trans-Alpine,</hi> inhabit on the North ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> about the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61906:120"/>River <hi>Rhone;</hi> the <hi>Tauricks,</hi> the <hi>Agonians</hi> and many other Barbarous Nations, live on the Skirts of the Plains we have been ſpeaking of: Thoſe <hi>Gauls</hi> differ nothing from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but becauſe they inhabit on the other ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> have given them that Appellation.</p>
                     <p>The very Tops of theſe Mountains are not habitable, by reaſon of the Difficulty of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and the perpetual Snow that covers them: The <hi>Ligurians</hi> live on the <hi>Appennines,</hi> and thoſe Mountains towards <hi>Marſeilles</hi> that join with the <hi>Alpes;</hi> poſſeſſing likewiſe the other two ſides that regard the <hi>Tuſcane</hi> Sea and the great Plains; but towards the Weſt they ſpread themſelves as far as <hi>Piſa,</hi> which is the firſt Town in <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-ſide, as far as <hi>Arrezzo.</hi> Then we come to the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> and <hi>Ombrians,</hi> their Borderers, who dwell on both ſides the Mountains we have mention'd. From thence the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines,</hi> which are there diſtant from the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi> Sea, at leaſt Sixty Miles, leaving the Plains, turn away to the Right-hand; and, dividing <hi>Italy,</hi> as it were in the midſt, run, ſtretching along, as far as the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Sea: As to the Plains but now nam'd, where the <hi>Appennines</hi> turn off, they extend to the Sea, and advance as far as <hi>Sienna.</hi> The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Po,</hi> (ſo much celibrated by the Poets, who have given it the Name of <hi>Erydanus</hi>) hath its Source in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> about that part
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61906:121"/>which makes one Point of the Triangle. This River runs firſt towards the South, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Country lying under thoſe Hills; and from thence falling into a level Country, it takes its Courſe towards the Eaſt, and by two Out-lets, runs into the <hi>Adriatick.</hi> It is the nobleſt and moſt uſeful River of the whole Continent of <hi>Italy,</hi> for the Waters that fall either from the <hi>Alpes</hi> or <hi>Appennines</hi> run thither. And as it is the greateſt, ſo it is the moſt beautiful; its Streams ſwelling to their greateſt height about the Month of <hi>July,</hi> when the Snows, by the exceſſive Heats are melted, and diſſolve from the Mountains. Veſſels navigate up this River, from the Sea, by the Out-let call'd <hi>Olana;</hi> from whence they ſail, at leaſt two hundred and fifty Miles into the Country. This River for many Miles together, preſerves its Water in one Chanel; but as it approaches towards the Sea, by the acceſſion of many other Rivers, it becomes divided into two Streams; and from the Country of the <hi>Trigaboles,</hi> it forms two Chanels, bearing two different Names; that of <hi>Padua,</hi> the other of <hi>Olana;</hi> where it makes the ſafeſt and moſt beautiful Port in all the <hi>Adriatick.</hi> The People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try call this River <hi>Bodencus.</hi> Other fabulous things ſpoken of it by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> namely, that <hi>Phaeton</hi> receiv'd his Fall into theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; of the Weeping Poplars; of the People going perpetually in Black, who inhabit
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61906:121"/>thereabout, to Commemorate the loſs of <hi>Phaeton:</hi> And, in a word, the many other Stories that have been invented, are too Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and in no wiſe uſeful to our preſent Purpoſe: Howbeit, we may have occaſion to make Recital of them elſe-where, to be able thereby the better to prove, that <hi>Timaeus</hi> was not ſufficiently inſtructed in the Hiſtory of this Country.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tuſcans</hi> then heretofore poſſeſs'd all the Champaign Country, and at the ſame time were Maſters of that which was call'd <hi>Phlaegria,</hi> bordering on <hi>Capua</hi> and <hi>Nola.</hi> And as that People had with great Reſolution, withſtood thoſe who Invaded them, they grew to have a mighty Name among Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and acquir'd much Reputation for their Courage and Vertue. Hence it comes to paſs that thoſe who read the Hiſtory of the <hi>Tyrrhenians,</hi> are to be cautious how they judge concerning that People, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Poſſeſſions, and the Country they now Inhabit; but are to conſider them by the Rule of thoſe Times of which we now ſpeak, and by the Authority and Power of which they were then Maſters. The <hi>Gauls</hi> liv'd in their Neighbourhood, by which means they had Commerce together; but in proceſs of Time, beholding ſo beautiful a Country with an avaricious and envious Eye, taking ſlight Occaſion for their Motive, they rais'd a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army, and attacking the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61906:122"/>Surprize, forc'd them to abandon all that Country bordering on the <hi>Po,</hi> and peopl'd it themſelves. The <hi>Laians,</hi> and <hi>Lebecians,</hi> and thoſe who border on the <hi>Inſubrians,</hi> which at that time compos'd a mighty Nation, were the firſt that inhabited that part of the River, towards the Eaſt. The <hi>Cenomans</hi> live likewiſe on the Banks of this River; and all beyond, as far as the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd by an ancient People call'd the <hi>Veneti,</hi> who ſpoke a different Language from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but much reſembl'd them in their Habit and Manners. The Tragick Poets have ſaid many fabulous things touching this People. Beyond the <hi>Po,</hi> near the <hi>Apennines,</hi> inhabit, firſt, the <hi>Anians,</hi> then the <hi>Bojans;</hi> after theſe, towards <hi>Adria,</hi> dwell the <hi>Aegones;</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>Senones,</hi> living near the Sea-coaſt.</p>
                     <p>In a word, theſe we have recounted, were the principal Nations that poſſeſs'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try we have deſcrib'd; they dwelt in Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, open, and without any Walls; they had few or no Moveables, they ſlept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Beds, they eat Fleſh, and their chief Employments were Husbandry and War, being totally ignorant of all other Arts and Sciences; their Subſtance conſiſted chiefly in Cattel and Gold; two Commodities that they could eaſily carry with them, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by any Accident they ſhould be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to remove: They underſtand making
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61906:122"/>their Court, and the Art of acquiring Friends, which they greatly covet; for he among them, who hath moſt Friends, is moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd; and he who is moſt honour'd, is moſt fear'd, and hath moſt Power. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, they were not only Maſters of this Country, but compell'd the neighbouring Nations, aw'd by the Fame of their Valour, to pay them Obedience. At length they made War on the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom, after they had vanquiſh'd in Battel, together with thoſe that took part with them, they purſu'd three Days together; and took, at laſt, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf, all but the Capitol.</p>
                     <p>But it happening, that ſome new Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures calling them home, the <hi>Veneti</hi> having march'd into their Country with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they Accorded a Peace to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and, reſtoring their City, departed. Then they fell into Civil Diſſentions; thoſe of them who inhabited the foot of the Mountains, beholding the Proſperity of theſe, with an Eye of Envy, join'd to make War on them. In the mean time, the <hi>Romans</hi> recover'd ſtrength, and enter'd into Alliance with the <hi>Latins.</hi> Thirty Years after the Taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Gauls</hi> made a ſecond Expedition, marching with their Army as far as <hi>Alba;</hi> but foraſmuch as the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſurpris'd by thoſe ſudden Motions of the Enemy, and had not leiſure to receive Aids from their Allies, they did not adventure to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61906:123"/>them. Twelve Years after this, the <hi>Gauls,</hi> with a powerful Army, attack'd them again; but the <hi>Romans</hi> having now timely notice of their Purpoſes, and leiſure to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon there Allies to their Aſſiſtance, march'd out to meet them, and offer them Battel; when the <hi>Gauls,</hi> out of Countenance at this their Bravery, began to waver in their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and grew, at length, to apprehend the Iſſue, and did not only not adventure to ingage the <hi>Romans,</hi> but ſecretly, by Night, rais'd their Camp, and fled as if they had loſt a Battel: Then they lay quiet for the ſpace of thirteen Years, when, obſerving the <hi>Romans</hi> Power daily to augment, they, at length, came to an Agreement with them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into Articles of Peace.</p>
                     <p>After thirty Years of Repoſe, the <hi>Trans-Alpine Gauls</hi> took Arms again, but fearing the Succeſs of the War, they compos'd the Difference by Addreſs and great Preſents, and remonſtrating the Evil of making War among themſelves, who were of one and the ſame Nation; a Pacification thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd, and they now labour'd to turn the joint Edge of their Courage againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> They march'd their Armies, therefore, in one entire Body, through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> (thoſe in that Country having taken part with them;) and after having ravag'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and taken much Booty, they retir'd home without Moleſtation; where they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61906:123"/>were no ſooner arriv'd, but they fell into Feuds about the Partition of their Plunder, which went ſo far, that it coſt them the loſs of the greateſt part both of their Booty and their Army. And this is a frequent Folly of that People upon any Succeſs, eſpecially if they happen to have Diſputes when they have drank Wine. Four Years after this, the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Samnites</hi> join'd their Arms, and made War on the <hi>Romans,</hi> giving them Battel in the Country of the <hi>Cluſians,</hi> who are likewiſe call'd <hi>Camartines,</hi> where they made great ſlaughter of them. But ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the <hi>Romans,</hi> inrag'd as it were by their Misfortunes, march'd againſt them with a freſh Army, and fighting with the ſame Enemy (having all their Legions in the Field) in the Country of the <hi>Sentinates,</hi> they got a memorable Victory, deſtroying the greateſt part of their Army, putting the reſt to flight, who retir'd back to their Country. Ten Years were hardly paſt, when the <hi>Gauls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd <hi>Arrezzo</hi> with a mighty Force, whither the <hi>Romans</hi> came to the Relief, and fought them in View of the Town, but were worſted, and retreated. <hi>Lucius</hi> the Conſul was ſlain; and <hi>Manlius</hi> ſucceeding, ſent Ambaſſadours to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> to treat about the Redemption of ther Priſoners; which Ambaſſadours were by them barbarouſly ſlain. This baſe Action of the <hi>Gauls</hi> greatly provok'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> who forthwith march'd with another Army
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61906:124"/>againſt them, giving Battel to the <hi>Senones,</hi> who had the Aſſurance to encounter them ſingly; but the <hi>Romans</hi> had the better, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling many of the Enemy, and compelling the reſt totally to abandon the Country; ſo they took poſſeſſion of the Territory of the <hi>Senones,</hi> and this was the firſt Colony they planted in <hi>Gaul.</hi> It is call'd <hi>Sena-gallia,</hi> from the name of thoſe <hi>Gauls,</hi> who before had held it: Of this Country we have already ſpoken, and ſhewn that it lies near <hi>Adria,</hi> on the Skirts of the Plains that are water'd by the <hi>Po.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bojans</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Senones</hi> expell'd their Country, and becoming apprehenſive of the like meaſure, betook themſelves to Arms, exempting none who were able to march; and having drawn the <hi>Tuſcanes</hi> to their Party, they march'd againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> And when their Troops on both ſides were drawn together, near the Lake of <hi>Vadimon,</hi> a pitch'd Battel was fought, wherein the greateſt part of the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> fell on the place, and but few of the <hi>Bojans</hi> eſcap'd by flight. Nevertheleſs, the Mind of this People was not ſubdu'd, who, making a new League, united all their Forces, and arming all the <hi>Gauls,</hi> compos'd a freſh Army, with which they gave Battel again to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but they were entirely defeated and diſpers'd; and thus humbl'd, they now ſend their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted them. Theſe Adventures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61906:124"/>
                        <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s Invaſion of <hi>Italy</hi> about four Years, and happen'd five Years before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Gauls</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> as if ſome fatal Influence, charg'd with a Commiſſion of Mortallity againſt this People only, had then reign'd; ſo ſeverely were they perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all Quarters of the World. As for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they reap'd by the Conteſts they had with them, two mighty Benefits; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, firſt, by a long Exerciſe of Arms in the many Conflicts they had with that People, wherein it was hardly poſſible for them to ſee or ſuffer more then befel them, they became admirably inſtructed in the Art of War; and this they made plainly to appear in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Hoſtilities with King <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, having thus tam'd and reduc'd this Savage Nation, they had the more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to attend their Affairs with that Prince, having nothing then to divert their Counſels or Forces; and, in concluſion, they conteſted, by that means, afterwards, with more Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the Dominion of <hi>Sicily</hi> with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gauls,</hi> after having ſuffer'd ſo many Loſſes and Calamities, remain'd quiet for the ſpace of five and forty Years, preſerving the Peace unbroken which they made with the <hi>Romans;</hi> but after the old Men, and that Generation were extinct that had taſted the Hardſhips, and felt the Sufferings of former Wars, the young Men that ſucceeded them,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61906:125"/>who knew nothing of Danger, and fear'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from Fortune, had a mind to exerciſe their Courage, and with a generous kind of Aſſurance took to their Arms, and renew'd the War againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon a very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Motive, drawing their Allies into the Confederacy. This Deſign was firſt form'd and conceiv'd among their principal Men, who aſſembled, and conſulted thereon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imparting it to the People; inſomuch, that when the Army of the <hi>Trans-alpine Gauls</hi> had march'd as far almoſt as <hi>Rimini;</hi> the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> who were not well aſſur'd of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, mutiny'd againſt their Officers, and attack'd the Army that had come thus far to join them; and having firſt kill'd their two Kings, <hi>Ates</hi> and <hi>Gallatus,</hi> they at length came to a Battel, wherein they mutually deſtroy'd each other. In the mean time, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were ſurpris'd, and aſtoniſh'd, at the News of this new Eruption of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> took the Field with their Armies; and when they came to underſtand, that the Enemy were defeated by their own Swords, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no farther, but march'd home. Five Years after this Adventure, during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip of <hi>M. Lepidus,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> made Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Lands taken from the <hi>Senones,</hi> in <hi>Cis-alpine Gaul,</hi> for <hi>Caius Flaminius,</hi> to make his Court to the People, had propos'd that Law, and had it receiv'd: But it may with good reaſon be averr'd, That 'twas this that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61906:125"/>firſt corrupted the Peoples Manners, and was the Cauſe afterwards of Civil Deſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. In ſhort, many of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and principally the <hi>Bojans,</hi> who had moſt cauſe of Fear, as being neareſt Neighbours to the <hi>Romans,</hi> perceiving, now, that their Deſigns were not ſo much for Glory and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as to ſubdue, and entirely exterminate their Nation and poſſeſs their Country, readily enter'd into the League that was now form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bojans</hi> and <hi>Inſubrians</hi> (who were the two greateſt People on that ſide) purſuant to their Deſign, ſent Ambaſſadours by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conſent, to the reſt of their Nation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting on the other ſide the <hi>Alp,</hi> about the <hi>Rhine;</hi> theſe People are call'd <hi>Goeſates,</hi> from their ſerving in the War for Pay; for ſo that word properly imports; and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their two Kings, <hi>Concolitanus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroeſtus,</hi> by means of great Sums of Mony, and by the hopes they gave them of rich Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that would be ſhar'd by this Enterprize, if they ſucceeded, ingag'd them to join in a War againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> giving them their Faith to aſſiſt and abide firmly by them; but the <hi>Goeſates</hi> were not hard to be perſwaded. And now, farther to incite them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded them of the Glory of their Anceſtors; who had not only vanquiſh'd the <hi>Romans</hi> in Battel, upon the like Expedition, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd and became Maſters of their City itſelf,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61906:126"/>and that being Lords of all the <hi>Romans</hi> held, kept their City ſeven Months in their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and at length, freely, and of their own meer Motive, reſtor'd it to that conquer'd People, as an Effect of their Generoſity, and afterwards return'd to their Country inrich'd with infinite Booty, without any Danger, Damage, or Impediment. Theſe Diſcourſes ſo animated the Leaders of the <hi>Goeſates,</hi> and incited them ſo powerfully to the War, that it may be ſaid, ſo great an Army never march'd out from among that Nation, nor braver and more war-like Men. In the mean time, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were not without Intelligence of what was agitated among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> ſaw their Danger, and perceiv'd it at hand; and juſtly fearing the Conſequence, apply'd themſelves to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of Troops, and making Proviſion of all things neceſſary for the War, and march'd with their Armies to defend their Frontiers, believing them already invaded, when the Enemy had not yet mov'd from their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Theſe Traverſes greatly avail'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in the proſecuting their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in <hi>Spain;</hi> for as we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were reſolv'd to put firſt a Period to their Diſputes with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> were conſtrained to yield to their Fears of an Enemy, whom they thought now in their Neighbourhood, and to poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone their Conſideration of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61906:126"/>Affairs on that ſide, till they ſhould have firſt compos'd and ſetled thoſe at home, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd and eſtabliſh'd the Commonwealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Danger that then threaten'd. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the Treaty being ratify'd, which they made with <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> their Thoughts were entirely taken up with the preſent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where it was agreed by all, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt courſe, was to come ſpeedily to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Goeſates</hi> having paſs'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> with a magnificent Army, furniſh'd with all ſorts of Arms, came and joyn'd the <hi>Cis-alpine Gauls,</hi> making their Rendezvous on the Banks of the <hi>Po.</hi> The other <hi>Gauls</hi> alſo came in after they had paſs'd the Country that heretofore belong'd to the <hi>Senones;</hi> the <hi>Inſubrians</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>Bojans,</hi> who continued in the ſame Opinion of proſecuting the War, joyn'd them; but the <hi>Veneti</hi> and <hi>Cenomani</hi> refus'd to be of the Confederacy, to whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſent their Ambaſſadours, prevailing with them, to prefer their Alliance with them, to that of the <hi>Gauls;</hi> ſo that the Bordering Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that People, were forc'd by that means to leave part of their Forces to ſecure their Frontiers, and with an Army of fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, twenty Thouſand Horſe, and as many Chariots, they began their March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> having now Intelligence that the <hi>Celtae</hi> had paſs'd the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61906:127"/>
                        <hi>Alpes,</hi> diſpatch'd with all Expedition the Conſul <hi>L. Emilius,</hi> with the Legions to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> there to make head againſt the Enemy, if they ſhould chance to Attack them on that ſide. They likewiſe ſent one of their Praetors towards <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> for the other Conſul <hi>C. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius,</hi> was gone at that time to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> with part of their Troops. But do what they could, their Fears were great at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they had Reaſon to conclude their City was in Danger enough; and indeed, none will wonder at their Doubts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, who conſider what Reaſon they had to bear in Mind the Calamities they had heretofore ſuſtain'd by the Invaſions of this Enemy. They drew together therefore their Armies, and levy'd new Forces, directed their Allies to have their Succours in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and order'd Muſter-rolls to be brought from all parts to the Senate, of all the young Men capable of ſerving, to the End they might take a certain Meaſure of their Strength; likewiſe they fill'd up their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with choſen Men, and order'd them forthwith to March: Furthermore they made ſo great Proviſion of Arms, and all things neceſſary for the War, that there was no Record of the like Preparation in any Age paſt; in a word, every one did his utmoſt to proſecute and advance ſo neceſſary a Work. For the People of <hi>Italy,</hi> terrify'd at this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> did not Act at this time
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61906:127"/>as meer Allies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to aid and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Deſigns of Dominion and Glory, but thought of nothing now but of Fighting, for their own proper Safety, their Families, and Fortunes, ſo that they receiv'd with Chearfulneſs the Orders that were ſent them from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here it will not be amiſs, to make an Eſtimate of the Power and Forces of that Commonwealth, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had the Boldneſs to attempt, and what an Empire it was that he made the Object of his Ambition, and wherein he ſucceeded ſo far as to Reduce the <hi>Romans</hi> to the laſt Gaſpe and Extremity of Fortune. Let us, I ſay, make a Computation of the Proviſion they made toward this War, whereby we ſhall perceive how far they had improv'd their Forces. With the Conſuls there march'd four Legions, in each Legion were five thouſand two hundred Foot, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, with them likewiſe march'd the Succours of the Allies, amounting together to thirty thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe: Furthermore, there joyn'd them of <hi>Sabins,</hi> and <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> above fifty thouſand Foot, and about four thouſand Horſe; theſe were all conducted to the Frontiers, under the Command of a Praetor, to oppoſe the Enemy there. From the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrians</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinates,</hi> who inhabitit the <hi>Appennines,</hi> there came in to the Number of twenty thouſand;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61906:128"/>the <hi>Veneti</hi> and <hi>Cenomanei,</hi> ſent the intire Number they were order'd, to the utmoſt Borders of the <hi>Gaules</hi> Territories, to make Inroads on the Country of the <hi>Bojans,</hi> and to force thoſe who were already departed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire yet farther, and keep them from joining with the reſt. In this manner, they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their Armies on the Frontiers. But at <hi>Rome</hi> they kept a Reſerve of Citizens, alwais ready to move, conſiſting of thirty thouſand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horſe, with a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of Troops of their Allies, of thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe. In the General Muſter-rolls that were brought into the Senate, were found fourſcore thouſand Foot of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and five thouſand Horſe; of the <hi>Samnites</hi> ſeventy thouſand Foot, and ſeven thouſand Horſe: The <hi>Japyges</hi> and <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapyges,</hi> who had likewiſe joyn'd with the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſent to their Aid in this War, fifty thouſand Foot, and ſixteen thouſand Horſe: The <hi>Lucans</hi> ſupplied them with thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and three thouſand Horſe: The <hi>Marſians, Marrucians, Ferentines</hi> and <hi>Veſtines,</hi> ſent twenty thouſand Foot and four thouſand Horſe. Furthermore, they had two Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Tarentum,</hi> conſiſting of four thouſand two hundred Foot, and two hundred Horſe each; and over and above all theſe, the ordinary People being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Campania,</hi> amounted to two hundred and fifty thouſand Foot, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61906:128"/>three and twenty thouſand Horſe; ſo that the Troops which depended immediately on the Senate, and were deſtin'd to the Guard and Preſervation of the City amounted to an hundred and fifty thouſand Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe, or thereabouts. But the whole Body of their Srength conſiſted in no leſs than ſeven hundred thouſand Foot, and ſeventy thouſand Horſe; and tho' <hi>Hannibal</hi> began with an Army of hardly twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend Men, he had nevertheleſs the Aſſurance to Invade and March into <hi>Italy,</hi> againſt this ſtupendous Force of the <hi>Romans:</hi> But this Point will be better clear'd when we come to Treat of thoſe Occurrences.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Arrival of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> they ravag'd and plunder'd the Country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controul, and from thence determin'd to proſecute their Deſign on <hi>Rome,</hi> and were now advanc'd near <hi>Cluſium,</hi> a Town but three Days March from the City, when News came, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army that had been poſted on the Frontiers of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was almoſt got up with their Rear: Whereupon they fac'd about, and march'd to meet them, full of Reſolution to come to a Battel. And now towards the Evening, the two Armies drew ſo near, that they were forc'd to incamp on the Ground where they were, leaving but a very ſtrait Space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Camps: But when Night was ſhut in, the <hi>Gauls</hi> lighting their Fires in their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61906:129"/>Camp, departed: Leaving their Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, with Orders to follow them the ſame way they took, with command at break of Day to ſhew themſelves to the Enemy. In the mean time, they take their March ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards <hi>Faeſula,</hi> where they halted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the coming up of their Horſe, and to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Enemy by Surprize, if they ſhould advance after them. In the Morning the <hi>Romans</hi> perceiving they were Retreated, and had left only their Horſe, eagerly went on the Purſuit, taking for granted that this Motion of the Enemy was a ſort of Flight. But they were no ſooner advanc'd within diſtance, when the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who lay in ambuſh, began to appear, and a very ſharp Conflict enſu'd, wherein the Boldneſs and Number of the <hi>Gauls</hi> prevail'd: Of the <hi>Romans</hi> there fell ſix thouſand on the ſpot, the greateſt part of the reſt making good their Retreat, to a riſing piece of Ground well ſituate for Defence, where they abode; the <hi>Gauls</hi> reſolv'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to beſiege them, but being now wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with Marching, and harraſs'd with the Service of the preceeding Day, they only left for that time a Party of their Horſe, on the Guard at the Foot of the Hill, where the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were intrench'd, and retir'd to refreſh and repoſe themſelves, with Reſolution the next Morning to attack and take them by Force, if they refuſed Conditions.</p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61906:129"/>
                     <p>In the mean while, <hi>L. Aemilius</hi> who had been ſent to <hi>Rimini,</hi> to Guard the Coaſt of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> ſeaſonably arriv'd: Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd Intelligence that the Enemy had enter'd <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and farther, that they were advanc'd towards the City, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately march'd to join the other Army. And now approaching thoſe who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd on the Hill diſcover'd them at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by their Fires, wherefore taking Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and diſguiſing ſome of their People, they ſent them privately through the Woods to give them an Account of the preſent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of their Affairs. The Conſul <hi>Aemilius,</hi> having not now leaſure for much Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, order'd the Tribunes to march with the Foot, by break of Day, while himſelf at the head of the Horſe, ſpeeds away directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words the Hill; but the Principal Officers of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who judg'd by the Fires they had ſeen over Night, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, held a Counſel, to debate, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how they ought to proceed: When the King <hi>Aneroeſtus</hi> advis'd them to conſider, with Caution, what they did; he ſaid, the Plunder they had taken, was already very great; their Priſoners and the Cattel, and other Booty of all ſorts, was beyond all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; that on this Conſideration, it ſeem'd to him that their beſt courſe was not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a Battel, which might prove the total Ruine of their Affairs; that the ſafeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61906:130"/>they could take, was now to retreat, and march back to their Country, while they might do it with ſafety; where, when they had diſencumber'd themſelves of their Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they might with eaſe return and ingage the <hi>Romans,</hi> if it were concluded reaſonable. So this Opinion of <hi>Aneroeſtus,</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and follow'd, and the <hi>Gauls</hi> decamp'd the ſame Night, taking their march along the Coaſt towards the Frontiers of <hi>Tuſcany, Aemilius</hi> having receiv'd into his Army thoſe Troops that were incamp'd on the Hill, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Defeat of the <hi>Romans,</hi> did not think it ſafe to give the Enemy Battel, but determin'd to keep in their Rear, and vigilantly take occaſions of advantage upon them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to recover, at leaſt, part of their Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But behold, at this very time, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſul, <hi>C. Atilius,</hi> being return'd with the Army out of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> was leading them along the Sea-coaſt, towards <hi>Rome;</hi> who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of what had paſs'd, happening to take the ſame way the <hi>Gauls</hi> did, and was marching not far before them. The Enemy was now arriv'd near <hi>Telamena,</hi> a Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> when ſome of their Forragers fell into <hi>Atilius</hi>'s hands, who gave him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of all that had paſs'd, aſſuring him, that both the one and the other Army were not far off, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> were at hand, and that <hi>Aemilius</hi> was hard at their Rear. The Conſul was a little perplex'd at the News;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61906:130"/>nevertheleſs, aſſur'd of Victory, by thus ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Enemy, and incloſing them between their two Armies, he order'd the Tribunes to draw up in Order of Battel, and to inlarge their Front as wide as the Ground would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly permit; and now having obſerv'd an Eminence which commanded the Way by which the Enemy muſt neceſſarily paſs, he goes himſelf at the Head of the Horſe, and takes Poſſeſſion of that Poſt; deſigning from thence, to give the firſt Attack, conceiving that the Honour of the Victory would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be in a great degree aſcrib'd to him; but the <hi>Gauls</hi> (who knew nothing of the Arrival of <hi>Atilius</hi>) believing that <hi>Aemilius</hi>'s Horſe had got before them in the Night, and had poſſeſs'd thoſe advantagious Poſts, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Horſe, and ſome choice Men of their Foot, to march, and beat them from that Ground; but receiving Intelligence, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Priſoners, that <hi>Atilius</hi> was there, they form'd their Battel of Foot in ſuch manner, as to be able to receive the Enemies Charge in Front and Rear; for they were aſſur'd, the one Army purſu'd them, and the other would not fail to Attack them in Front. This at leaſt they ſtrongly conjectur'd, both by the Intelligence they had receiv'd, and by the Countenance and Actions of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>The Conſul <hi>Aemilius</hi> had been inform'd that the Legions were landed at <hi>Piſa,</hi> but he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61906:131"/>could not hope they were arriv'd ſo near; but as ſoon as he perceiv'd the Diſpute upon the Hill, he took for granted his Collegue was now at hand, whereupon he ſent a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Horſe to ſuſtain them, and after having form'd their Foot according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline, they mov'd toward the Enemy. The <hi>Gauls</hi> plac'd the <hi>Goeſates</hi> in their Rear, believing that <hi>Aemilius</hi> would find them Work there; next to them were poſted the <hi>Inſubrians;</hi> in the Front were the <hi>Tauriſques,</hi> and thoſe that inhabit beyond the <hi>Po.</hi> Thus the two Bodies being drawn up, Rear to Rear, they fac'd likewiſe toward <hi>Atilius,</hi> to receive his Charge. All their Chariots and Baggage were diſpos'd on the Wings. Their Plunder they had carried to a neigbouring Hill, where they left it under a good Guard. So the Army of the <hi>Gauls</hi> being drawn up, I ſay, facing two ways, was not only terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold, but were in effect form'd in the moſt proper manner, to receive the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. The <hi>Inſubrians</hi> and <hi>Bojans</hi> ingag'd, cloath'd only in thin and light Garments; But the <hi>Goeſates</hi> (ſuch was their Fool-hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Opinion of their Strength) ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping themſelves naked, march'd in that manner in the Front of the Battel, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing their Swords; conceiving that in that Equipage they ſhould not be only able to uſe their Arms with more freedom, but being eas'd of their Garments, they ſhould
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61906:131"/>find leſs Impediment from the Buſhes and Briers that might moleſt them in time of Action. The firſt Diſpute was on the Hill we mention'd, where great Bodies of Horſe fought and attack'd each other, mingling and fighting without any Order. Here <hi>Ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the Conſul, ingaging too far, was ſlain, whoſe Head was immediately carried to the <hi>Gauliſh</hi> King. But this did not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, who maintain'd their Poſt, and repuls'd the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>And now the Foot came to join Battel, where the manner of the Encounter was not only violent and terrible to thoſe who were ingag'd, but alſo, will alwais appear ſo, to ſuch as ſhall hear the Relation; and to whoſe View the Pen of the Hiſtorian ſhall Deſcribe it. In a word, where three Armies were thus ingag'd, who will not conclude, but the Spectacle of ſuch a Battel, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the Conteſt, was wholly new and ſurprizing? Furthermore, who would not at this Day judge, or, who would not then have concluded, that the Manner and Order wherein the <hi>Gauls</hi> were drawn up, would not either prove fatal to them, as being to receive an Enemy in Front and Rear; or that it ought to contribute to the Victory, as having two Armies to deal with, they had order'd it ſo, that dividing their Army, one part thereof ſuſtain'd the other, whereby the Enemy could never attack their Rear? Over
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61906:132"/>and above, all Temptations of Flight were by that means taken away, for they could neither go forward, nor retire, and in caſe they ſhould happen to be vanquiſh'd, they were bereft of all means of Eſcape, which is an advantage only to be found, when an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is ſo form'd, fronting two ſeveral ways. The <hi>Romans</hi> were not however without their Reaſons to expect Succeſs, who had their Enemy ſurrounded and hemm'd in on all ſides; while on the other hand, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Appearance, and the tumultuous Noiſe of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Army, gave them Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour enough: For, beſides the mighty Sound of their Inſtruments, and other Martial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments wherein they abound, the Shouts and Clamours of their Soldiers was ſo great, that not only their Inſtruments and their Men, but the adjacent Hills that environ'd them, ſeem'd to eccho and reſound the Noiſe. Moreover, the Countenance and Behaviour of thoſe who march'd naked at the Head of their Army, was a Sight entirely new; thoſe Gyant-like Men, ſtrong and well faſhion'd, in the prime and ſtrength of their Age, where you beheld none in their firſt Ranks, who were not adorn'd with Chains, Collers, and Bracelets of Gold: In a word, as this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Spectacle could not but give the <hi>Romans</hi> Terror, ſo the hope of ſuch a Booty lent them Aſſurance alſo.</p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:61906:132"/>
                     <p>When the light arm'd Troops were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, a good diſtance before the Army, had begun the Battel by a ſhower of Weapons they caſt at the Enemy, the Garments of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who were in the ſecond Ranks, did in ſome ſort defend their Bodies: But it far'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the <hi>Goeſates,</hi> who fought naked in the Van; for theſe finding their Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quite contrary to what they expected, knew not how to behave themſelves, or what courſe to take; for the <hi>Gauls</hi> Bucklers being ſmall, never cover their Bodies entirely, at beſt; ſo that theſe Men, who were of the largeſt Size, were by that means the leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, inſomuch, that few Darts were caſt at them without effect; and now being thus gall'd, and not able to defend their Bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, who, at a diſtance attack'd them, they grew, at length, inrag'd, and deſpera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of their Safety; ſome threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves headlong on the Enemy, where they found preſent Death: Others retiring by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, as they were able, manifeſted their Fear by their Retreat, troubling and diſordering the Ranks in their Rear. So the <hi>Roman</hi> Javelins were too hard for the <hi>Goeſates</hi> Courage, and abated that vain Confidence of theirs, which was, indeed, the beſt part of their Soldierſhip. But now the <hi>Roman</hi> Cohorts advanc'd, after they had order'd their light arm'd Parties to retire into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61906:133"/>and ſoon came to the Swords point with the <hi>Inſubrians, Tauriſcans,</hi> and <hi>Bojans,</hi> who fought it out with great Reſolution; and tho' they were preſs'd hard, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute was very bloody, nevertheleſs, they ſuſtain'd the Shock, and kept their Poſt, and may be truly ſaid to be inferior to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> only in their Arms, which were not, by much, ſo ſerviceable in Battel as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Bucklers are made ſo, as to cover their whole Body, and their Swords much more proper for Service; while thoſe of the <hi>Gauls</hi> were only barely for cutting. At length, the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, that had been ingag'd on the Hill, came down, and attack'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> in Flank, wherein they perform'd ſingular Service; in ſhort, the <hi>Gauls</hi> were beaten, forty thouſand ſlain, and ten thouſond taken Priſoners; among whom was <hi>Concolitanus,</hi> one of their Kings, <hi>Aneroeſtus,</hi> the other King, with a ſmall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſcap'd by Flight to a certain Village, where, ſoon after, he kill'd himſelf, as did the reſt who were with him. The Conſul, <hi>Aemilius,</hi> order'd the Spoils of the Enemy to be ſecur'd, which were ſent to <hi>Rome;</hi> but whatſoever had been taken from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he order'd to be reſtor'd: Then he march'd the Army along the Confines of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi> and fell on the Lands of the <hi>Bojans,</hi> where, after he had glutted the Soldiers with Plunder, he led the whole Army back to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61906:133"/>
                        <hi>Rome;</hi> where he adorn'd the Capitol with the Enſigns he had taken, and hung up their Collars, and Bracelets, and Chains of Gold, reſerving the reſt of the Spoils, and the great number of Priſoners, to adorn his Triumph, when he ſhould make his Entry into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Behold, now, the Succeſs of this mighty Expedition, which had threaten'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Romans,</hi> with ſo dreadful a Storm. After this Victory, the <hi>Romans</hi> began to be in hopes they ſhould be able to force the <hi>Gauls</hi> out of all the Country bordering on the <hi>Po.</hi> The two ſucceeding Conſuls, <hi>Q. Fulvius,</hi> and <hi>Titus Manlius,</hi> marching againſt them, with an Army well provided of all things neceſſary; whereupon the <hi>Bojans,</hi> on their firſt Attempt, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted into Submiſſion, putting themſelves under the <hi>Roman</hi> Protection: But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be a Seaſon of great Rains, and the Plague likewiſe having infected their Army, nothing afterwards memorable was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in that Expedition.</p>
                     <p>The Conſuls, who ſucceeded them, <hi>P. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and <hi>C. Flaminius,</hi> march'd with their Armies into the Territories of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> by the Frontiers of the <hi>Anamures,</hi> a People who inhabit not far from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> by whoſe Friendſhip, which they had gain'd, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls had liberty to paſs againſt the <hi>Inſubrians,</hi> on that part where the River <hi>Ada</hi> runs into the <hi>Po;</hi> where being attack'd by the Enemy,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61906:134"/>both at the Paſſage of the River, and where they were about to incamp, they were not able to perform any thing to purpoſe at that time; entring, therefore, into Treaty with that People, they retir'd out of their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Afterwards, having a long time march'd too and fro, about the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they paſs'd the River, and came into the Lands of the <hi>Cenomani,</hi> who were their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, with whom joining, they fell a ſecond time on the <hi>Inſubrians,</hi> where they made great Spoil. Whereupon the Princes of that People, obſerving there was no end of the Moleſtation the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, at length, to put all to the hazard of a Battel; accordingly, having aſſembl'd and rendezvous'd all their Troops in one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, they poſſeſs'd themſelves of all the Treaſure, Jewels, and Gold belonging to the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and by them call'd Immoveables, with which they made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of all things they needed to further their Deſign; and being now well provided, they march'd chearfully againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and incamp'd in their view, with an Army of fifty thouſand fighting Men. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> plainly ſaw, the Enemy much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in number, and were therefore think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to re-inforce their Army by an Addition of thoſe <hi>Gauls,</hi> who were in Amity with them; but when they conſider'd the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of that People in all their Treaties
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61906:134"/>and Negotiations, and that thoſe, whoſe Aids they were to uſe, were of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the others againſt whom they were to draw their Swords; they cou'd not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determine to truſt them in an Affair of ſo mighty importance. Wherefore, they found this Expedient; they order'd the <hi>Gauls,</hi> their Allies, to paſs the River, remaining with their own Army on the other ſide, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing the Bridge, the River not being fordable, they kept them, at leaſt from ſiding with the Enemy, ſince they could not reſolve to truſt them as Friends. By this means too, their own Army was left without any Hopes, but in Victory, for there was no Retreat, but by the River, and that was now unpaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; after this was done, they prepar'd to receive the Enemy. The Soldiers deſerv'd great Commendations by the Addreſs and Skill they ſhew'd in this Battel, having been inſtructed, it ſeems, how they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves ſingly, or in a Body: For the Tribunes had remark'd in their former Conflicts, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> were not formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but in the Ardour of the firſt Attack, that their Swords were of ſuch a faſhion and temper, that they could give but one good out or two; and then they would ſtand bent in their Hands, and if they had not time to ſtreighten them, with their Foot on the Ground, they became of no more uſe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Tribunes diſtributed among the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61906:135"/>firſt Cohorts, the Javelins us'd by the <hi>Triari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were thoſe that march'd in the Rear ranks; commanding the Soldiers, firſt to make uſe of thoſe Arms, and then to draw their Swords. And now, when they came to ingage, they attack'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> as they had been order'd, whoſe Swords, by the firſt ſtrokes on the <hi>Roman</hi> Javelins, became bent and uſeleſs; then the <hi>Romans</hi> advancing nearer with their Swords, got ſo within them, that they had not room to lift their Arm to take a cutting ſtroke, which is their manner of Fighting, whoſe Swords have no point: While thoſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> on the contrary, being faſhion'd for cutting and thruſting, redoubling the one after the other, they cut and pierc'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> in the Face and Breaſt, and made a terrible ſlaughter among them. Thus the <hi>Gauls</hi> were beaten, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Day principally attributed to the Prudence and Ability of the Tribunes; for the Conſul <hi>Flaminius</hi> was to ſeek, and had not ſufficiently provided for the Safety of the Army; who drawing up near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, had ſo order'd it, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were deprived of one great Benefit, which they make uſe of in Battel, leaving them not ſpace enough betwixt their Rear and the River to retire, when occaſion ſhould make it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: ſo that, if during the Battel, the <hi>Romans</hi> had been preſs'd never ſo little, they had no whither to retire, but into the River; ſo
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61906:135"/>great an Overſight was the Conſul guilty of in that occaſion. But ſo it happen'd, as we have related; that the <hi>Romans,</hi> by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, got a ſignal Victory, returning to <hi>Rome</hi> loaden with Spoil and Glory.</p>
                     <p>The following Year the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadours to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to treat of a Peace, on whatſoever Conditions they ſhould pleaſe to grant it; but the Conſuls <hi>M. Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> and <hi>Cn. Cornelius,</hi> would not yield to treat with them; whereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make their laſt Effort, and put it once again to the hazard of War. They therefore diſpatch'd Orders for levying of Men among the <hi>Goeſatae,</hi> who inhabit about the <hi>Rhone,</hi> of which People having taken thirty Thouſand into their Pay, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd in Arms in expectation of the Enemy. About the beginning of the Spring, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls lead their Armies into the Territory of the <hi>Inſubrians,</hi> and beſieg'd the City of <hi>Acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> ſituate between the <hi>Po</hi> and the <hi>Alpes.</hi> In the mean time, the <hi>Inſubrians</hi> were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do their beſt to raiſe the Siege, but knew no way how to ſuccour the Beſieg'd, the Enemy being poſſeſs'd of all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; they therefore paſs'd the <hi>Po</hi> with ſome of their Troops, and marching them into the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, ſat down before <hi>Claſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi> The Conſuls receiving this News, <hi>M. Claudius Marcellus,</hi> taking with him all the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, and a good Body of Foot,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61906:136"/>march'd away with diligence to the Relief of that Place, of whoſe coming the <hi>Gauls</hi> having got Intelligence, riſe from before it, and march in Battalia againſt him; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ingage, they made for a while a good ſtand againſt the Horſe, but being at length charg'd in Flank and Rear, they were forc'd to yield the Advantage to the <hi>Romans,</hi> betaking them to flight. Many periſh'd in the River, which they attempted to repaſs, and more were ſlain on the Spot. <hi>Acerres</hi> likewiſe ſoon ſurrender'd, where had been lodg'd great ſtore of Ammunition, and the <hi>Gauls</hi> retir'd to <hi>Milan,</hi> which is the Capital City of the <hi>Inſubrians.</hi> But <hi>Cornelius</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd them without loſs of time, and march'd after them thither, where the <hi>Gauls</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing during his ſtay; but on his march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back towards <hi>Acerres,</hi> they follow'd him, and attacking his Rear, kill'd many, and put the reſt of the Army to flight; till <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> facing about at the Head of the Van-guard of the Army, commanded thoſe that were flying, to make a ſtand, and face towards the Enemy: Theſe Orders being obey'd, the <hi>Romans</hi> make Head againſt them that charg'd their Rear. But the <hi>Gauls,</hi> fleſh'd with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which they thought now ſure, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd for a time the Charge, but it was not long e'er they gave Ground, and, flying, ſought Sanctuary in the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whether <hi>Cornelius</hi> follow'd them, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61906:136"/>then march'd into the Country, which he ſpoil'd and harraſs'd, and advancing to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> took it by force. So that after this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, the Princes of the <hi>Inſubrians,</hi> finding it in vain further to contend, ſubmitted, and put themſelves under the Protection of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold now the Succeſs of the War, which the <hi>Romans</hi> wag'd againſt the <hi>Gauls;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if we conſider the Courage and Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Enemy; the mighty Battles and the Multitudes that compos'd their Armies, and the Slaughter of Men in the Field; we ſhall be oblig'd, without doubt, to conſent, that Hiſtory affords none that may paralled it; while if, on the other hand, we weigh their Deſigns and Enterpriſes, and the blind and ſhallow Adminiſtration of their Affairs in all things, we ſhall ſee nothing therein that doth not juſtly beget our Contempt; for the <hi>Gauls</hi> are ever tranſported by Heat and Fury, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conducted by Reaſon and Council, we will not ſay for the moſt part, but in all their Determinations. And now having related how ſoon after they were beaten from their Seats in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Po,</hi> ſome few places excepted under the <hi>Alpes,</hi> we therefore held it but reaſonable to relate how they came firſt into <hi>Italy,</hi> what they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and in a word, how they were at length totally exterminated. For it ſeems to me to be the Duty of an Hiſtorian, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61906:137"/>future Times in theſe memorable Events, which are no other than the Sports and Entertainments of Fortune, leſt Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, thro' want of due Information, ſhould be to ſeek for Examples to fortifie their Minds againſt the frequent and temerarious Deſcents of theſe Barbarians. Furthermore, Inſtruction may be gather'd by the Example now before us, how certainly they may be repell'd, where they are reſiſted with Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that we ought to ſuffer every thing, rather than yield to them in any thing. And there is no doubt, but thoſe who have oblig'd Poſterity with the Relation of the <hi>Perſians</hi> Expedition into <hi>Greece,</hi> and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the <hi>Gauls</hi> upon <hi>Delphos,</hi> gave great Light to the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Deſigns after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of reſcuing their Countries Liberty. For if the mighty things perform'd by them, were duly weigh'd; what Myriads of Men, and what wonderful Preparations were loſt and defeated, by the ſingle Vertue of a few, who had a right Knowledge in the Art of War, and were led by the Conduct of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: There would be no Force ſo great, nor Armies ſo numerous that might not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted: And who would not run any Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and ſuffer any Extremity to win Glory, and redeem his Coutry? In ſhort, the <hi>Greeks</hi> were not moleſted, only in the Days of our Fore-fathers, but even frequently in our Times; which was in part my Motive for
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61906:137"/>giving the World this ſhort Hiſtory of the Acts of that People, and albeit, it be but an Epitome, it comprehends, at leaſt, their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the beginning of their Enterpriſes. But it is now time to remember from whence we have digreſs'd.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General, had govern'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> for the ſpace of eight Years, he was treacherouſly murder'd in his Tent by a certain <hi>Gaul,</hi> provok'd by ſome Injury he had receiv'd. This Leader had greatly augmented the Dominion of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> not only by Force of Arms, but by his Wiſdom, and the Gentleneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gain'd and attracted the Good-will of many Princes of that Nation. After his Death, notwithſtanding the Youth of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made him his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour in the Govenment of <hi>Spain;</hi> who, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his other promiſing Qualities, gave Indications of an extraordinary Courage and Greatneſs of Mind; and was no ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in his Government, but it was eaſie to foreſee by his Actions and Councils, that he meditated a War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> which, in effect, ſoon after came to paſs. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were already on Terms of Jealouſie, and Provocations had been mutually given, by Injuries done on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on their part could not digeſt their Loſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which they long'd to revenge, and ſecretly laid their
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61906:138"/>Deſigns to effect it; while the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were not without Intelligence of their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, were on their Guard, inſomuch as it was now viſible to every Eye, that it could not be long before a War would break out between thoſe two States. It was likewiſe about the ſame Period of Time, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians</hi> and King <hi>Phillip,</hi> with the reſt of the Confederates, ingag'd in a War againſt the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> which was call'd the War of the Allies. But ſince we have already treated of the Affairs of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and touch'd what was memorable therein, and purſuant to the Method we have propos'd, are now arriv'd at the ſaid Confederate War, and the ſecond that was wag'd between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> call'd by ſome the War of <hi>Hannibal;</hi> where we promis'd ſhould be the Commencement of our Hiſtory, it will therefore be neceſſary, without entertaining the Reader with farther Digreſſion, that we come now to ſet down the Occurrences of <hi>Greece,</hi> to the end, that having previouſly and ſummarily made the Way plain before us, by reducing the general Account of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to one and the ſame Period of Time, we may thence take the Beginning of the General Hiſtory, we have eſpecially under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to write, wherein the Cauſes will be found very viſible, which have produc'd ſo wonderful Effects.</p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:61906:138"/>
                     <p>Furthermore, in regard our Deſign is not laid to write the Story and Adventures, of any one ſingle or particular Nation; as ſome have done that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and others of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but on the contrary, ſince we have determin'd to make a General Hiſtory of Occurrences in all thoſe Parts of the World, that have fallen under our Obſervation, it will not be therefore unprofitable to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe principally of thoſe Places and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are moſt Eminent and Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; inaſmuch, as becauſe the preſent Age ſufficiently furniſhes Materials for that Work, and in caſe we do not inlarge on that Subject here, we ſhall however, ſupply it elſe-where. Touching the <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> it may ſuffice to Treat of their Affairs, no higher than from our own Times; ſince their Story of remoter Date, has been already the Subject of divers Authors, to to which every one may have Recourſe. And indeed they have ſeen ſo few Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Changes of Fortune of late, that there will be no need to reſort to diſtant Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to be enlightned in their Affairs. On the other hand, the Hiſtory of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and the Royal Family of <hi>Macedon,</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a neceſſary Recourſe to Antiquity, in regard the latter is now quite extinguiſh'd, and the other by their good Conduct and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, riſen to a marvellous Height of Proſperity: For tho' it hath been the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61906:139"/>of many heretofore, to perſwade the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> to a Union, for their common Defence and Safety; which could not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be brought to paſs, inaſmuch, as thoſe who have ſeem'd to contend therein, could never relinquiſh their own Intereſts and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, while they deliberated for the Publick. Wherefore, this Felicity was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for our Days, and is accompliſh'd in ſuch a manner, as that they are not only United by a firm Alliance, but the better to faſten the Bond of Union, their Laws are now the ſame, as alſo their Mony, Weights and Meaſures; furthermore, they have the ſame Magiſtrates, the ſame Council, and the ſame Judges: So that to comprize all in one Word, <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> is not one entire City and Corporation, only becauſe one Wall does not Begirt and Environ it; every thing elſe is Uniform throughout all their Cities. And it would be no fruitleſs Curioſity, to enquire why, and for what Reaſon, the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſians</hi> began to take upon them the Name of <hi>Achaians;</hi> for thoſe who were firſt ſo call'd, were a People no more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than their Neighbours; neither for their Riches, the number of their Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor the Vertue of their People. In a word, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were ſuperior to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> both in Numbers and Extent of Dominion. And there was hardly any Nation through the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61906:139"/>of <hi>Greece,</hi> that did not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their Equals, both in Valour and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; how then comes it to paſs that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians,</hi> and thoſe who have ingag'd in that Confederacy, and are become the ſame in Government and Name, are riſen to that height of Reputation? It were Blindneſs and Folly to aſcribe it to Accident, or a meer Effect of the Indulgence of Fortune. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us then, to ſearch out, and determine the Cauſe, for without that, nothing can be effected that comes to paſs; whether done by the Guidance of right Reaſon, or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly done without any Reaſon all. My Judgment of the Cauſe then is this: That firſt it is impoſſible to find a Republick, where Liberty and Equality, and in a word, where popular Government is better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, or where more wholſom Laws are to be found, than among the <hi>Achaians,</hi> this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited many of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> Cities to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, of their own Accord, their Form of Government; many likewiſe were won to receive it by the Force of Reaſon and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; and ſome were conſtrain'd by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and yielded with a ſort of Choice to what they foreſaw they ſhould ſhortly not be able to refuſe. While in the mean time the Founders of this Inſtitution reap'd no Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Advantage by their Change, who no ſooner receiv'd their Laws, but they were admitted to the ſame Fellowſhip of Right with the reſt.</p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:61906:140"/>
                     <p>In brief, the <hi>Achaians</hi> compaſs'd this great Deſign, principally by two Things, which ſeldom fail of Effect; namely, Equality and Benignity; and there is great appearance of Reaſon that that was the chief and moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Motive to this Concord, which growing and eſtabliſhing by degrees, acquir'd to the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> ſo much Power and Wealth. But this Right is to be done the <hi>Achaians,</hi> that it muſt be confeſs'd, the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have mention'd, was Originally and of Old among them; which appears by manifold Teſtimonies, but it ſhall ſuffice at this time to exemplifie only one or two.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Burning and Deſtroying the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the <hi>Pithagoreans,</hi> by a ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, in that part of <hi>Italy</hi> call'd <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graecia,</hi> there enſu'd great Commotious among the Principal Magiſtrates by that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Adventure. All the <hi>Greek</hi> Towns on that Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> were fill'd with Sedition, Tumult and Murders; ſo that to recover and eſtabliſh Union and Tranquility among them, Ambaſſadours were diſpatch'd to them from all parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> howbeit, the Council only of the <hi>Achaians</hi> was choſen to cure thoſe great Evils, and compoſe the Diſſentions that were grown among them. Nor was it in this only that the People expreſs'd their Eſteem of the Laws and Inſtitutions of the <hi>Achaians;</hi> but all thoſe Governments ſoon after, by common Conſent, agreed to imitate them, and to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61906:140"/>Form themſelves according to the Example of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Republick. Whereupon the <hi>Crotoniates,</hi> the <hi>Sybarites,</hi> and the <hi>Cauloniates,</hi> Uniting in one Body, agreed to build a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Jupiter Homorius,</hi> Decreeing that Place for the Congreſs of their General Aſſemblies. In a word, they receiv'd the <hi>Achaian</hi> Laws, and reſolv'd conformably to Govern their States. And if any thing therein was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alter'd, it was not out of Choice, but ſtrong Neceſſity; for on the one hand <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and the Barbarians on the other, who were too powerful for them to contend with, often compell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Afterwards, about the time of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> Defeat in the Battel of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> (an Occurrence which ſurpriz'd all the World) when the <hi>Thebans,</hi> contrary to the general Opinion, had acquir'd the Dominion of <hi>Greece,</hi> there grew great Troubles and Commotions every-where, and principally between the <hi>Lac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon the <hi>Achaians,</hi> of all the <hi>Greeks,</hi> were mutually choſen to be the ſole Judges of this Controverſie, not by an Argument of their Power and Greatneſs, there being no State at that Time in all <hi>Greece</hi> that was not Superiour to them in Strength, but merely in regard of the Virtue and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61906:141"/>which they manifeſted in all their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, which had acquir'd them the good Opinion of the whole World. But they had nothing elſe at that time to boaſt of, but good Counſel, and a Diſpoſition to improve their Fortune, not having it in their Power to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as to what may concern the others, we ſhall diligently, and more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, recount their Actions. In brief, I have, upon good Deliberation, concluded, that the Work I have undertaken, will be leſs difficult for me, and more advantageous for the Reader, to take my Beginning from the time when the <hi>Achaians,</hi> (who had been divided by the Power of the Kings of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>) began to Unite and Incorporate, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as from thence may be dated the Birth of that Power and Greatneſs, which by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Growth and Augmentation, hath at length arriv'd at that height of Proſperity wherein we now behold them, and whereof we have already taken notice.</p>
                     <p>It was in the Hundred and twenty fourth Olympiad, when the <hi>Patraeans</hi> and <hi>Dimoeans</hi> laid the Foundation of the Union; in the ſame Olympiad, wherein <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus, Lyſimachus, Seleucus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Ceraunus,</hi> dy'd. And if we would extend our Proſpect yet further back, behold the State of the <hi>Achaians: Tiſamenus,</hi> Son of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> flying from <hi>Sparta,</hi> upon the return of the <hi>Heraclidoe,</hi> govern'd in <hi>Achaia,</hi> and was the firſt King of that People; the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by him there founded, was continu'd in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61906:142"/>a rightful Succeſſion down to <hi>Gyges,</hi> whoſe Sons rendring him odious by their Tyrannical Practices, the firſt Form of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became chang'd, and reduc'd to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State, which laſted to the time of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great; and albeit their Affairs were govern'd and regulated according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Times, and Occurrences, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs all poſſible Endeavours were us'd to preſerve the Form of a popular State. The Commonwealth was compos'd of Twelve Cities, which are in being at this Day, <hi>Olenus</hi> and <hi>Helice</hi> only excepted, which were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up by the Sea, in an Earth-quake, that happen'd not long before the Battel of <hi>Leuctra;</hi> which Cities are <hi>Patra, Dyma, Phara, Trytoea, Leontium, Aegira, Pellene, Aegium, Bura, Ceraunia, Olenus,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</hi> After the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſince the Olympiad we have mention'd, theſe Cities fell into dangerous Diſſentions, chiefly by the Artifices of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Princes, when every City apart meditated on nothing but their own private Profit, and Ends, to the Prejudice and Deſtruction of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and this gave occaſion to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and <hi>Caſſander,</hi> and afterward to <hi>Antigonus Gonatus,</hi> to put Garriſons in ſome of their Cities, and that others were invaded and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Tyrants, who in thoſe Days were very numerous in <hi>Greece.</hi> But about the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and four and twentieth Olympiad,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61906:142"/>when <hi>Pyrhus</hi> invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> theſe People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſee the Errour of their Diſſentions, and labour'd to return to their former Union. Thoſe who gave the firſt Example, were the <hi>Dymoeans</hi> the <hi>Patroeans,</hi> and the <hi>Pharoeans;</hi> Five Years after thoſe of <hi>Aegium,</hi> having caſt out the Garriſon that was plac'd over them, were receiv'd into the Confederacy. Thoſe of <hi>Bura,</hi> follow'd their Example, having firſt kill'd the Tyrant; and ſhortly after, thoſe of <hi>Ceraunia</hi> did the like: for <hi>Iſeas</hi> their Tyrant, conſidering how that thoſe of <hi>Aegium</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd their Garriſon, and he who govern'd in <hi>Bura,</hi> was already ſlain by the Practices of <hi>Marcus,</hi> and the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and that it would be his Lot to have them all quickly for Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he therefore reſign'd the Dominion; after having firſt ſtipulated with the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for his Indemnity for what was paſs'd, and ſo incorporated the City into the Union of the <hi>Achaians.</hi> But it may be demanded, Why we take ſo remote a View into Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? To which we Anſwer, Becauſe, in the firſt place, we would ſhew after what Manner, and at what Time this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was founded, and who were the firſt of the Ancient <hi>Achaians,</hi> that laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and to the end it may appear that we ſay nothing without Proof, of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that People, and that what we have Recorded is too evident to be confuted, it is manifeſt they have all along obſerv'd the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61906:143"/>ſame Methods of Government. So that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to Equality and Liberty, which is in the utmoſt Perfection among that People, and oppoſing their Arms againſt thoſe, who by themſelves, or by the Aſſiſtance of ſuch Princes as would willingly have had them fallen into Servitude; they have been able to compaſs their great Deſign, partly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and partly by their Confederates. In ſhort, we may have recourſe to their Laws, and Inſtitutions, to be ſatisfy'd in what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſucceeded. For, in a word, tho' they have been, in many Occaſions of greateſt moment, ſerviceable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs their Succeſs never alter'd them, or lent them Ambition to Exalt their Fortune, but they barely contented themſelves to be permitted, in reward of the good Offices they had render'd their Allies, Liberty only to every one in particular, and a Confirmation of the general Union of <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> But this will be more evidently ſeen by their Actions.</p>
                     <p>The Cities, then, we have mentiond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd for the ſpace of five and twenty Years, to preſerve their Form of Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd, chuſing in their General Aſſembly, two Praetors and a Secretary. Afterward they concluded to have but one Praetor only, who ſhould be charg'd with the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Affairs; and the firſt who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd that Dignity, was <hi>Marcus</hi> the <hi>Carian,</hi>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61906:143"/>who, after four Years of his Adminiſtration, gave place to <hi>Aratus</hi> the <hi>Sicyonian,</hi> who, at the Age of twenty Years, after he had by his Vertue and Reſolution reſcu'd his Country from Tyranny, join'd it to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> ſo great a Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had he from his Youth for the Manners and Inſtitutions of that People. Eight Years after, he was a ſecond time choſen Praetor, and won <hi>Acro-corinth,</hi> which <hi>Antigonus</hi> had fortify'd with a Garriſon, whereby <hi>Aratus</hi> freed all <hi>Greece</hi> from no ſmall Apprehenſion: when he had reſtor'd Liberty to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he united it to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> together with the City of <hi>Megara,</hi> which he got by Intelligence during his Praetorſhip. All theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd about a Year before the laſt Battel that was fought between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> for the Dominion of <hi>Sicily,</hi> when the latter were oblig'd to quit their Claim, and become Tributaries to the <hi>Romans.</hi> In a word, <hi>Aratus,</hi> who, in a ſhort ſpace, brought many and great things to paſs, made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by his Counſels and Actions, that his greateſt Aim was the Expulſion of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> out of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> to ſuppreſs Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and aſſert the Liberty of his Country. So that, during the whole Reign of <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Gonatus, Aratus</hi> conſtantly oppos'd all his Deſigns and Enterpriſes, as he did the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> to raiſe themſelves on the Ruines of their Neighbour States. And
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61906:144"/>as in all the Tranſactions of his Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he gave ſingular Evidences of a ſteady Mind and firm Reſolution, all his Attempts ſucceeded accordingly, notwithſtanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny States confederated to hinder the Union, and to deſtroy the Commonwealth of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> enter'd into a League with the <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and generouſly aſſiſted them in their War againſt <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſo that the ancient Hatred between theſe two People ſeem'd for the preſent extinguiſh'ſt, and the Deſire of Concord began, by degrees, to grow in the Minds of the <hi>Aetolians; Demetrius</hi> reign'd ten Years, and dy'd about the time that the <hi>Romans</hi> made their firſt Expedition into <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> when many great and noble Occaſions were given to the <hi>Achaians</hi> of finiſhing the Project they had conceiv'd. For the Tyrants who reign'd in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> having loſt the Support of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who greatly favour'd them, began now to Deſpair; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, being aw'd by <hi>Aratus,</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd them to quit their Governments, on Promiſe of great Honours and Rewards to ſuch as voluntary reſignd, and threatning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with Hoſtility, who refus'd: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they reſolv'd to Deſpoil themſelves of their Dignities, reſtore their People to Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Incorporate them with the <hi>Achaians.</hi> As to <hi>Lyſiadas,</hi> the <hi>Megalapolitan,</hi> he wiſely

                     <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> began to conceive Jealouſie at the growing Greatneſs and extraordinary Succeſs of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and according to their natural Malice and Ambition, but principally in Hopes they ſhould be able to break the Union of thoſe Cities that were already join'd, as it had been concerted with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and was heretofore brought to paſs, when they ſhar'd the <hi>Acharnanians</hi> with <hi>Alexander;</hi> incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, therefore, now by a Proſpect of the like Succeſs, they baſely enter'd into a League with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who at that time govern'd <hi>Macedon,</hi> during the Minority of <hi>Philip,</hi> then a Child; they did the like alſo with <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> King of the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In ſhort, they ſaw <hi>Antigonus</hi> now at Leiſure, with the whole Power of <hi>Macedon</hi> at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and were well aſſur'd of his Enmity to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> on the Occaſion of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of <hi>Acro-corinth;</hi> ſo that, making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61906:145"/>that if the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bore no good Will to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> would heartily join with them in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt that People, it would not be difficult to ſucceed in their Enterpriſe, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they ſhould be able to Attack them in earneſt, and Invade them on all ſides at once: Nor would the <hi>Aetolians</hi> have been without Reaſon to hope ſome Succeſs in their Deſign, had they not omitted one principal Conſideration; namely, that they were to have to do with <hi>Aratus,</hi> whoſe great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſuffic'd to obviate and prevent all the ill Effects that could be threaten'd. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an unjuſt War on the <hi>Achaians,</hi> it came to paſs, that it did not only not ſucceed as they had propos'd; but on the contrary, as by the Wiſdom of <hi>Aratus,</hi> who was then Praetor, their Deſigns were broken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; ſo the Confederacy became ſtronger, and the <hi>Achaians</hi> greater than before; and by what ſhall be further related, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how they effected their Purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aratus,</hi> then, conſidering that the ſenſe of the Benefits the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had receiv'd by the Friendſhip of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> during the War with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> with-held them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, out of Shame, from openly declaring War againſt them, though at the ſame time, they ſecretly practis'd with the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and manifeſted ſo violent an Hatred to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> that when <hi>Cleomenes</hi> fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61906:145"/>attack'd them, and ſurpriz'd <hi>Tegea, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinea</hi> and <hi>Orchomena,</hi> they were not only not touch'd or concern'd at that Outrage and Violation, but did their beſt to confirm him in the Poſſeſſion of thoſe Cities. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their natural Avarice, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie which Paſſion, a very ſlight Occaſion ſuffic'd to provoke them to War, with thoſe who had hardly injur'd them; yet could they tamely ſuffer, not only breach of Faith, but willingly yielded up great Cities to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of others, in proſpect that the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> might at length ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him a Match for the <hi>Achaians. Aratus,</hi> therefore, and the Chiefs of the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, determin'd not to declare War againſt any one, and to apply themſelves only to withſtand the Deſigns of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> at leaſt theſe were their firſt Thoughts: But when they had further penetrated the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and ſaw him building a Fortreſs in the Territory of the <hi>Megalopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> call'd <hi>Athenaeum,</hi> and that the War became by that means manifeſtly proclaim'd againſt them; they then call'd an Aſſembly of the States, and therein it was declar'd that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſhould be reputed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. In this manner, and at that time the War began, which was call'd the <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menic</hi> War.</p>
                     <p>This War was at firſt manag'd and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd by the ſingle Strength and Forces of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61906:146"/>the <hi>Achaians,</hi> who had the Reſolution to march alone againſt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it more for their Glory to attempt their Defence, without borrowing Aids from abroad; but bearing in memory the good Offices which had been done them, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> they endeavour'd to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Friendſhip, and to poſſeſs him with a Belief, that their entire Confidence was in him. But when the War began to grow upon them, and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had deſtroy'd the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Government, and of a free State had converted it to a Tyranny, <hi>Aratus</hi> obſerving that that Prince manag'd the War with no leſs Ability than Force, began to be in pain for the Event, and being jealous of the Arts and Infidelity of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> he thought it Wiſdom to endeavour to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-work, and perplex them in their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes. He therefore conſider'd that, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi> who govern'd in <hi>Macedon,</hi> was a Man of Experience, and of his Word, and that he was willing enough to make Alliances; and was not without this Conſideration too, That Princes have naturally neither Friends nor Enemies, but meaſure Amities and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, by the Rules of Intereſt; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour'd after a good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that Prince, and determin'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the joining the Forces of the <hi>Achaians</hi> with his. But there were many weighty Reaſons that convinc'd him, this was an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61906:146"/>that could not ſafely be treated openly; for in a word, he was well aware that <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> and the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> would not only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, but the <hi>Achaians</hi> themſelves would have reaſon to Deſpair, when they ſhould ſee their Praetor applying to their Enemy: Which they would interpret an Effect of his Doubt of their Forces, which he thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by all means to prevent. He reſolv'd therefore to proſecute his Purpoſe with ſuch Caution, as to leave no room for Suſpicion; and the better to bring it to paſs, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd both to do and ſay many things in the Eye of the People, that to them beſpoke quite other Intentions than thoſe he had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd; thus he kept his Deſign undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and that indeed ſeems to be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he hath made no mention thereof in his Commentaries. Furthermore, <hi>Aratus</hi> was not ignorant that the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> by their Neighbourhood to the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> ſtood expos'd above all others to the Violence and Incommodities of the War, which they could not without great Repugnance under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and that the <hi>Achaians</hi> would not be able to yield them effectual Succours, by reaſon of their own Straits. He likewiſe knew their great Inclinations to the Houſe of <hi>Macedon,</hi> in Memory of the many Favours done them by <hi>Philip</hi> Son of <hi>Amintas,</hi> ſo that he juſtly collected that whenever they ſhould come to be hard preſs'd by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61906:147"/>ſort for Succour to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians.</hi> There were two principal Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> namely <hi>Nicophanes</hi> and <hi>Cercidas,</hi> with whom <hi>Aratus</hi> correſponded, who were Men wen well qualify'd for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the Enterprize he was meditating; to theſe he imparted the Secret, and by their means brought it ſo about, that the <hi>Megalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> decreed to ſend Embaſſadours to the Aſſembly of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> to move them to ſolicit Succours from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> by their Ambaſſadours. So <hi>Nichophanes</hi> and <hi>Cerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> were themſelves ſent to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> with Orders to proceed on to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> if they approv'd the Propoſition; which they did, and conſented that the Ambaſſadours ſhould purſue their Orders.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Nichophanes</hi> had his Audience of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he touch'd the Affairs of his own Country, in few words, ſpeaking no more than what was juſt fit; but he enlarg'd, and made him a long Diſcourſe, purſuant to the Inſtructions of <hi>Aratus,</hi> of Affairs in General. Which Inſtructions imported the mighty Conſequence of the Alliance between <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> and the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and whither it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that it was true, the <hi>Achaians</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feel the firſt Evils of it, but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt and moſt dangerous Effects threatned <hi>Antigonus;</hi> that it was not difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the <hi>Achaians,</hi> were not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Match for thoſe two People, in caſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61906:147"/>they ſhould attack them; and that it was yet eaſier to foreſee, to thoſe who rightly judg'd of Affairs, that the Ambition of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> and the <hi>Aetolians</hi> was not likely to be limited to the ſingle Conqueſt of the <hi>Acha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians;</hi> and that they would ſtop there; that <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> wou'd prove but a ſmall Morſel to the Avarice of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> when <hi>Greece</hi> itſelf was not thought ſufficient; that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> albeit he made Shew to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with the Dominion of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> there was no reaſon to doubt, but that whenever he ſhould compaſs ſo great a ſhare of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he would extend his Ambition to the Subjection of all <hi>Greece,</hi> which it would be impoſſible to bring to paſs, without firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarchy. The Ambaſſadours therefore were to pray him to deliberate maturely which was likely to be the ſafeſt Counſel for him to take; whether to Succour the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Beotians,</hi> in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and to counterplot his Deſigns upon <hi>Greece</hi> in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> or by neglecting the Occaſion of conciliating the Friendſhip of ſo great a People, become liable at length to ſuſtain a War in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> for the Empire of <hi>Macedon,</hi> not only with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians,</hi> but with the <hi>Beotians</hi> and <hi>Achaians</hi> themſelves. They were in ſhort, to let <hi>Antigonus</hi> know, that if the <hi>Aetolians</hi> continu'd their Nutrality, as they yet ſeem'd to do out of ſhame, to deal
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61906:148"/>ungratefully with thoſe from whom they had receiv'd ſo many good Offices during their War with <hi>Demetrius:</hi> That in ſuch caſe the <hi>Achaians</hi> would ſtand alone againſt the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and if Fortune favour'd their Councils, they ſhould not be driven to reſort to any foreign Aſſiſtance. But in caſe other Reſolutions ſhould be taken, and that the <hi>Aetolians</hi> ſhould join with the Enemy, That he ſhould then be mov'd to weigh with his beſt Wiſdom the State of Things, and not to permit the occaſion to be loſt of timely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring, and preventing the Ruine of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians,</hi> of whoſe Fidelity and Gratitude there could be no Reaſon to doubt. In ſhort, the Ambaſſadours gave him Aſſurance, That whenſoever theſe Matters ſhould corne in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, <hi>Aratus</hi> would be prepar'd to give ſuch Security for their fair Proceeding, as ſhould be pleaſing to both Parties, and that he himſelf would take upon him to demand it whenſoever Aſſiſtance ſhould be needful. <hi>Antigonus</hi> having heard the Ambaſſadours, acknowledg'd the Counſel of <hi>Aratus</hi> to be very wiſe and wholſome, and from that time forward kept a more vigilant Eye on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences. He likewiſe writ to the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolitans,</hi> aſſuring them of his Aſſiſtance, whenſoever the <hi>Achaians</hi> ſhould declare it neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Upon the return Home of <hi>Nicophanes</hi> and <hi>Cercidas,</hi> they deliver'd the Letters of <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:61906:148"/>and made known the good Diſpoſition wherein they found that Prince, whereupon the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> took Courage, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with deliberated to go to the Aſſembly of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and move them to join with <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi> and to loſe no time in putting their Affairs into his Management. And now, when <hi>Aratus</hi> had been given to underſtand by the Ambaſſadours how kind <hi>Antigonus</hi> had appear'd to the <hi>Achaians</hi> in general, and to himſelf in particular; he was not a little pleas'd to find his Project ſucceeed ſo well, and that <hi>Antigonus</hi> prov'd in his Compliance, ſo contrary to the Opinion of the <hi>Achaians;</hi> for he was aſſur'd that the Inclination which the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> had ſhewn to commit the Conduct of the War to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> by the Conſent of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> could not but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute to the Succeſs of his Deſigns. For, notwithſtanding that <hi>Aratus,</hi> as we have obſerv'd, wiſh'd there might happen no Occaſion to call in Foreign Aids, and that he labour'd all that was poſſible to prevent it; nevertheleſs, he thought it the ſafeſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that could be taken, if they ſhould chance to be ſtraitned, to ſecure the Friendſhip of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> provided the Motion might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed meerly from the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and that it might not appear it was compaſs'd by his Procurement. For, in ſhort, as he could not anſwer for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who might be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to change his Mind, ſo he was in the right
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61906:149"/>to do his beſt, to ſhun the Blame that might be due to him, for the Miſchiefs that might befal his Country in caſe, after <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſhould have come to their Relief, and ſucceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> he ſhould chance to attempt any thing to the Detriment of the Republick. And on the other hand, he juſtly fear'd, that if <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſhould declare himſelf their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, no Body would arraign him of Injuſtice, after the Violation acted by the <hi>Achaians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> in the Surprize of <hi>Acro-Corinth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore upon the arrival of the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolitans</hi> at the Aſſembly, where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Letters, and after they had deliberated on the great Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Affection that Prince had made them; and, in a word, had remonſtrated the preſſing Occaſion of calling him to their Aid, and that the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> wiſh'd it above all things: Then <hi>Aratus</hi> ſtood up to ſpeak, and, after he had exaggerated the Benefits of <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Friendſhip, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the Determination of the People, he made a long Exhortation to diſpoſe them by all means, if it were poſſible, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their Defence and Safety by their own Forces alone, inaſmuch, as nothing could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them more Glorious, or more Profitable: And that if after all their Efforts, Fortune ſhould prove averſe, then that they might have recourſe to their Friends, but that they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61906:149"/>ought firſt to perform the utmoſt they were able, by their own ſingle Forces.</p>
                     <p>This Opinion of <hi>Aratus</hi> being approv'd, by a general Vote of the Aſſembly, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to proceed no further for that Time, and that the <hi>Achaians</hi> ſhould attempt at leaſt to ſuſtain the War by themſelves. In the mean time, <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who deſpair'd of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Friendſhip with the <hi>Achaians,</hi> began to manifeſt his Good-will to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> by ſupplying him with Neceſſaries; for, as he believ'd the Power of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would be likely to go further towards the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the Deſigns of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> than the <hi>Achaians,</hi> he theretofore did what he could to irritate <hi>Cleomenes</hi> againſt <hi>Antigonus;</hi> contributing his part towards the expence of the War. But after the <hi>Achaians</hi> were worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> firſt near <hi>Licoeum,</hi> where they met by accident; and afterwards, in a Battel near <hi>Magalopolis.</hi> And, in ſhort, after their Defeat, and the loſs of their prime Strength, in the Territory of <hi>Dymaja,</hi> near a Place call'd <hi>Hecatombaeum,</hi> finding the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their Affairs to admit no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Delay, the preſent Danger in which they ſaw themſelves, prevail'd on the <hi>Achaians</hi> unanimouſly to conſent to implore Succours of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> accordingly <hi>Aratus</hi> diſpatch'd away his Son, and ratify'd the Treaty that had been made with that Prince, touching the Aſſiſtance he was to give them. But
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61906:150"/>now a weighty Objection appear'd, likely to obſtruct the Accord, for they took it for granted, that <hi>Antigonus</hi> would demur to their Supply till <hi>Acro-Corinth,</hi> together with the City, ſhould be reſtor'd to his Poſſeſſion; which he would make to be the Seat of the War; and the <hi>Achaians</hi> could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to yield up thoſe Places without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> firſt obtain'd; which was the Occaſion of ſome Delay, and gave them leiſure to deliberate about adjuſting the Sureties.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Succeſſes had given the Alarm on all ſides, who proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his good Fortune now without danger or moleſtation, taking ſome Towns by fair means, and others by force; and having made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Caphya, Pellene, Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus, Argos, Phliunte, Cleone, Epidaurus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione, Troezene,</hi> and, in ſhort, of <hi>Corinth</hi> it ſelf; he march'd on, and incamp'd near the City of <hi>Sicyon.</hi> The difficulty was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, that moleſted the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the Praetor, while the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who, tho' they had ſignifi'd they were ready to joyn and march with them, were on the contrary found to have confederated with <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and invited him to receive them. This gave the <hi>Achaians</hi> then a Pretext which juſtifi'd their Determination, and which <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> readily improv'd, who had already given <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſome hopes that <hi>Acro-corinth</hi> ſhould
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61906:150"/>be put into his Hands; which having now perform'd, the ſcenſe of the Injury heretofore done to the Kings of of <hi>Macedon,</hi> became by that means remov'd, and the Alliance more firmly ratifi'd for the Time to come; and, what was farther conſiderable, <hi>Antigonus</hi> was by that means, put in Poſſeſſion of a proper Fortreſs, whereby to manage the War with the <hi>Lacedemonians. Cleomenes,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready promis'd himſelf the Principality of all <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> receiving Intelligence of the Alliance concluded between <hi>Antigonus</hi> and the <hi>Achaians,</hi> forthwith retir'd from before <hi>Sicyon,</hi> and march'd and incamp'd his Army near the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and fortifi'd with a Ditch and Rampart, the whole Space between <hi>Acro-Corinth</hi> and the <hi>Onion</hi> Hills. In the mean while <hi>Antigonus</hi> had been long in a readineſs to enter upon the War, and attended only the Motive from <hi>Aratus;</hi> and making a Judgment according to the Advices he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> would ſoon be on his march with his Army, he therefore ſent to <hi>Aratus</hi> and the <hi>Achaians,</hi> himſelf being then in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> to exhort them to put in effect the Promiſes that had been made him, and then march'd with his Army towards the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> by the way of <hi>Euboea.</hi> For the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who had attempted all other means before to prevent the Conjunction of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> with the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and were ſtill ready to do their utmoſt to hinder the ſame, had
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61906:151"/>intimated to him, that he ſhould not attempt his paſſage with an Army by the Streights of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> and that if he did, they would oppoſe him with an Army. When <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> arriv'd at the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> he incamp'd juſt oppoſite to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> with deſign to block up his paſſage into <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, notwithſtanding the Affairs of the <hi>Achaians</hi> were in a ſtate deſperate enough; nevertheleſs, they chang'd not their Purpoſe, and were not deſtitute of Hope; and they no ſooner ſaw <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the <hi>Argian,</hi> oppoſing the Partizans of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> when they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately march'd to their Aſſiſtance, and by the Conduct of <hi>Timoxenes,</hi> they got poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and became Maſters of <hi>Argos</hi> by Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; and it is reaſonable to believe, that that Succeſs gave Riſe to the Proſperity of their Affairs. For, firſt of all, this Adventure gave check to the Impetuoſity of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and greatly diſhearten'd his People, as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences will explain it by and by.

                        <hi>Cleomenes</hi> receiving Intelligence, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> had ſent home his Army, and that himſelf, with a ſmall Guard only of Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61906:152"/>remain'd at <hi>Aegium,</hi> which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three Days Journy from <hi>Megalopolis;</hi> and knowing that City to be of great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, and but thinly peopl'd, which, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it as it ought, would require a great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; and furthermore, having notice, that by reaſon of their preſent Neighbourhood to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> they kept very negligent Guard; and what was yet a farther Inducement, he knew, that the greateſt part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, able to bear Arms, had been loſt in the two Battels that had been fought, the one near <hi>Lycoeum,</hi> and the other near <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> as was noted; upon theſe Motives then, he gets by Night into the Town, without giving the leaſt Suſpicion, conducted by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> who had been banniſh'd their Country, and had taken Sanctuary in <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> But in the Morning, when the Alarm was taken, it wanted but little, that the Inhabitants had not driven him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, both his Perſon and his People being brought into manifeſt danger, as it happen'd to him about three Months before, when he ſecretly got into the ſame Town, at a place call'd <hi>Colaeus.</hi> But he being now the Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and poſſeſs'd of all the advantagious Poſts, ſucceeded in his Attempt; and, in ſhort, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vanquiſh'd the Inhabitants, became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Place; and was no ſooner in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, when he put in practice ſo many Outrages and Cruelties of War, that he left
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61906:153"/>not ſo much as any Appearance, that it had ever been a peopl'd Place. In my Judgment, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> gave himſelf up to that degree of Inhumanity, out of Revenge, that he could not prevail at any time (how difficult ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) to ingage any one of the <hi>Clitorians, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolitans,</hi> or <hi>Stymphalians</hi> to be of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, depend on his Fortune, or betray their Country to him; yet was the Generoſity and love of Liberty amongſt the <hi>Clitorians</hi> ſtain'd by the Wickedneſs of one Man, namely, <hi>Thearces,</hi> tho' they juſtly deny him to be a Native, but that he was the Son of an <hi>Orcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> Soldier reſiding among them. And, tho' there be extant <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Hiſtory of thoſe Times, there are ſome who give greator Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to <hi>Clearchus,</hi> who diſſents from him in many Particulars; the ſafeſt and wiſeſt courſe, therefore, eſpecially while we follow <hi>Aratus</hi> touching the Atchievments of <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> will be to ſift and examine things nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, to the end, it may not be our Fault, if Falſhood prevail over Truth. In ſhort, <hi>Clearchus</hi> has deliver'd many things without Judgment or Conſideration, but we are not to make his Proceſs, and detect his Errors in this place; we ſhall barely content ourſelves, to relate nakedly, the Occurrences of thoſe Times, and the Tranſactions of the <hi>Cleomenic</hi> War, and that will ſuffice to expoſe the Weakneſs of the Author, and ſhew, what we are to gather from his Hiſtory. When
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61906:153"/>
                        <hi>Clearchus</hi> then would ſet forth the Cruelties of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and even of <hi>Aratus</hi> himſelf, and the <hi>Achaians,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, That when the <hi>Matinoeans</hi> fell into the Hands of the Enemy, they were ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to unſpeakable Calamities; and that their City, which was the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ancient of all <hi>Arcadia,</hi> was reduc'd to ſo great Miſery, as it drew Tears of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from the whole Body of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In brief, when he hath a mind to move Pity in the Minds of his Readers, and touch them by his Diſcourſe, he repreſents Women embracing each other with melting Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in their Mouths; he expoſes them with diſhevel'd Hair, and naked Breaſts, and adds Tears and Complaints of Men, Women, and Children, Young and Old drag'd away promiſcuouſly: In a word, it is his manner thus to paint and deſcribe things, when he would give us an Image of Sorrow and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. Whereupon I obſerve it is beneath the Dignity of ſolid Minds to be taken with ſuch Entertainments, wherein Women only can receive Diverſion. Behold then what is proper and ſpecifick to Hiſtory, and wherein conſiſts the Benefit that we receive by that Study; It is not the Buſineſs of an Hiſtorian to affect the Reader with recounting of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, and relating things for the ſake of the Novelty and Oddneſs of the Matter, nor to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61906:154"/>wander after Subjects, that with difficulty may be allow'd to have a reſemblance of Truth; nor to aggravate things; all which is properly the Poets Theme; but to ſet down plain Truth, and report punctually what was ſaid or done to the leaſt Circumſtance. In ſhort, Poetry and Hiſtory have two different Ends, or are rather totally incompatible: The Art of Poetry is to ſtrike the Heart, and move the Paſſions, and to beget a preſent Pleaſure, by a Diſcourſe that hath nothing but a likeneſs of Truth to recommend it: But the Deſign of Hiſtory is to inſtruct the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future Ages, in the exact Verity both of Words and Actions. Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho' falſe, predominates in Poetry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Spectators there come to be deceiv'd; but Truth is to govern in Hiſtory, for its End is Profit and Inſtruction. And yet there are Hiſtorians who give us Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the moſt important Occurrences, without reporting to us either the Cauſes, the Beginning or the Reaſon of Things; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if we are left ignorant, what juſt Motive will their be either for Compaſſion or Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? In a word, who would not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to ſee a Man of free Condition beaten and ſeverely treated? And yet if this Man's Guilt hath begot his Sufferings, no Body will wonder. If Correction, and the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good Diſcipline, be the Motives of his hard Treatment, the Authors deſerve Thanks
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61906:154"/>and Praiſe. Is it not held likewiſe a heavy Crime to kill a Citizen? And yet we may kill a Citizen, deſtroy a Thief or an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and the Law ſaves us harmeleſs. And if we kill a Traytor or a Tyrant; inſtead of Puniſhment; Honours and Rewards are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for ſuch Actions: ſo true it is, that the Juſtice or Iniquity of what we do, depends not on the Fact, but on the Cauſes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the Purpoſe of the Actors, and the Difference that is found between them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mantinoeans</hi> then having withdrawn from the Confederacy of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> with whom they were once in Alliance, gave up themſelves, their Town and Territory to the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> And not long after they made the ſame Preſent to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and while they were incorporated with the <hi>Lacedemonians, Aratus</hi> gaining Intelligence with certain of the Inhabitants, the <hi>Achaians</hi> took it by force, four Years before the arrival of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and, in a word, they were ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Puniſhment for the Fault of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that on the contrary, the Union and Reconciliation of thoſe two People was as ſtrange, as the Revolution was ſudden, and unlook'd for: For <hi>Aratus</hi> was no ſooner in poſſeſſion of the Place, when he expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad all manner of Plunder and Hoſtility, but cauſing the Inhabitants to aſſemble, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to take Aſſurance, and fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to apply themſelves to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61906:155"/>Buſineſs and Callings, and that no manner of hardſhip ſhould be offer'd them, while they continu'd Members of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Republick. Whereupon, thoſe of <hi>Mantinoea,</hi> who could not have hop'd ſuch gentle Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ſo ſudden a Change, ſoon alter'd their Sentiments; and they who but now were Enemies to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and fighting againſt them, had loſt many Friends and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens; receiv'd now the ſame <hi>Achaians</hi> as Inmates into their Houſes, and as they would their neareſt Friends; performing mutually all Offices of Friendſhip and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie one to another. Nor was it indeed other than Juſtice, for I believe it may be with Truth averr'd, that there are but few Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſuch Lenity in an Enemy; and that ſcarce any People ever had ſo light a Feeling of a Misfortune, accounted among the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that befal us, as the <hi>Mantinoeans,</hi> did through the Humanity of the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Aratus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards by their own Importunity, preſs'd by the ſeditious Practices of ſome of their Citizens, who kept Intelligence with the <hi>Aetolians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> Ambſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were ſent to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> to demand a Garriſon for their better ſafety. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Achaians</hi> appointed three Hundred of their Citizens to be choſen by Lot for that Service; and thoſe whoſe chance it was to go, left their Fortunes and their Country,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61906:155"/>to take up their abode in <hi>Mantinoea,</hi> to aſſert and defend the Liberties of the Inhabitants. Theſe were accompanied with two Hundred Mercenaries, who joyntly contributed to the Conſervation of the Eſtabliſh'd Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: But not long after, inſtigated by the ſeditious Practices of the Diſaffected, they call'd in the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> to whom they gave up themſelves and their Town, and put all the <hi>Achaians</hi> to the Sword, who had been ſent thither to ſuccour and defend them; than which, could there be a more perfidious Act? For, in a word, ſince they had determined to change their Party, and to forget the good Offices they had receiv'd from the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and the Friendſhip that had been cultivated between them; they might, one would think, have ſpar'd the Lives of theſe poor People, and diſmiſs'd them at leaſt in ſafety to their Country, as not being liable to any Conditions which might ariſe by any new Treaty; for according to the Right of Nations, that Favour is afforded to Enemies in the like adventures. But the <hi>Mantinoeans,</hi> of their own meer Motion, acted that criminal Part, and violated an Univerſal Law, to give an Earneſt to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to Engage in any thing they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them. In this manner, then having with their own Hands ſlain thoſe who had reſtor'd them their Town and their Liberty,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61906:156"/>after they had taken it by force, and who were then actually guarding them; what degree of Indignation ſeems due to ſuch Treachery? Or rather let me ſay, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Puniſhment can be conceiv'd equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to their Crime? Perhaps it may be urg'd, That upon reducing the Town, themſelves, their Wives, and Children ought to be fold into Captivity. To which I anſwer, That by the Rules of War, that is no worſe Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than is practis'd towards thoſe who have no Crime for which to account. They merited therefore certainly the moſt rigorous Puniſhment that could be thought on. But if their Uſage was no other than <hi>Phylarchus</hi> reports it, it would have ſeem'd juſt, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhould have abſtain'd from the Compaſſion he mentions, but rather that they ſhould proclaim the Praiſes of thoſe who could not endure to puniſh ſo vile and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a Proceeding with the Rigour it deſerv'd. And now, albeit the <hi>Mantinoeans</hi> ſmarted no more for their Miſdeeds than the Pillage of their Goods, and the ſelling all of free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; this excellent Hiſtorian refines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Rules of Truth, and labours to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every Paſſage ſtrange and extraordinary, ſuperadding ſuch Falſhoods as want even the leaſt reſemblance of Probability; and ſuch was the blindneſs of his Folly, that he could not ſee to ſet down what was done under his Eye; for the <hi>Achaians,</hi> at the ſame time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61906:156"/>
                        <hi>Tegea</hi> by force, proceeded in no wiſe with the <hi>Tegeans</hi> as they had done with the <hi>Mantinoeans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, if it had been out of the native Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> that the <hi>Mantinoeans</hi> were ſo hardly dealt with, how comes it to paſs, the <hi>Tegeans</hi> eſcap'd ſo eaſily, who fell into their Hands about the ſame time? If the <hi>Mantinoeans</hi> were then the only People that ſuffer'd ſuch Severity at the Hands of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> it may be fairly inferr'd that they had merited, by their extaordinary Crimes, that extraordinary Puniſhment. Our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian further ſays, That when <hi>Ariſtomachus</hi> of <hi>Argos,</hi> who had been Tyrant there, and whoſe Anceſtors had been Tyrants, fell into the Hands of <hi>Antigonus</hi> and the <hi>Aachains,</hi> they carry'd him to <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> where they put him to ſo cruel a Death, that there is ſcarce an Example of ſo great Inhumanity. Furthermore, he feigns, according to his Cuſtom, that his Cries amidſt his Torments were heard into the Streets, inſomuch that the People preſs'd into the Priſon, where they were affrighted at the Barbarity of his Uſage, which they could not behold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Horrour and Deteſtation. But let us not dwell too long on this Pomp of Tragedy, whereof we have ſpoken ſufficiently. For my own particular, I take for granted, that tho' <hi>Ariſtomachus</hi> had never injur'd the <hi>Achaians,</hi> there could have been no Death too ſevere for
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61906:157"/>his manner of Life, and the Crimes he had committed againſt his Country.</p>
                     <p>But our Author, to exalt the Glory of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtomachus,</hi> and excite greater Compaſſion for what befel him, ſays, That he was not only a Tyrant, but deſcended of Tyrant Anceſtors. Now, I pray, what more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted or infamous Character could he have given him? For moſt ſure I am, that the Name only of Tyrant, contains the height of all Impiety, and comprehends all that Man's Imagination can compaſs or conceive of criminal outragious Wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>But as to <hi>Ariſtomachus,</hi> if he ſhould have ſuffer'd greater Torments than are ſet forth by our Hiſtorian, they would have been found ſhort of his Due, for one only mercileſs Act of his, on the occaſion of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly getting into <hi>Argos</hi> at the head of a Party of <hi>Achaians,</hi> where being expos'd to manifeſt Danger, fighting for the Liberty of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> he was at length compell'd to retire, for that through the terrour People were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Tyrant, none had Reſolution to ſuccour or ſide with him in the Attempt. Upon this Adventure, <hi>Ariſtomachus</hi> forms a Deſign to gratifie his Cruelty, pretending there were Conſpirators in the City, who held Intelligence with the <hi>Achaians;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, in cold Blood, and in the preſence of his Friends, he cauſes no leſs then fourſcore innocent Perſons, of the principal Citizens,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61906:157"/>at once to loſe their Heads. I forbear to make mention of the Vileneſs and Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his Life, and of his Anceſtors, which would ingage me in too long a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>But what I have ſaid may ſuffice to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it was no Injuſtice to award him the ſame Meaſure he had dealt to others; we rather ought to conclude, it would have been Injuſtice, if his Death ſhould have happen'd without ſome ſence of Torment, after he had acted ſo many criminal Parts.</p>
                     <p>It will not therefore be found a juſt Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Cruelty in <hi>Antigonus</hi> or <hi>Aratus,</hi> if, being taken in the heat of War, <hi>Ariſtomachus</hi> was condemn'd to die by Torments, if in times of Peace he deſerv'd no leſs; and that thoſe who ſhould have compaſs'd his Death, would have merited Applauſe and Rewards, from every honeſt Man. But over and above what we have obſerv'd, having violated his Faith, and broken his Truſt, with the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> what Puniſhment could they think too great? In ſhort, <hi>Ariſtomachus</hi> a little before the Death of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> being in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and reduc'd to the utmoſt Extremity, forlorn and deſpoil'd of his Dominion, found an <hi>Aſylum</hi> among the <hi>Achaians,</hi> who receiv'd him with all poſſible Gentleneſs. They not only forgot and forgave the Crimes and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of his Tyranny, but admitted him to a Share of the Adminiſtration of the State, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61906:158"/>conferr'd on him the Truſt of Commanding and Conducting their Army, and did him other great Honours; while he, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, upon the firſt Shadow of Advantage tender'd him by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all theſe Obligations, and Deſerting the <hi>Achaians,</hi> at a time of their greateſt Diſtreſs, joyn'd with their Enemies: So that falling at laſt into their Hands; what hard Meaſure would it have been, to carry him to <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> and there to put him privately to Death, and in the Night as our Author reports; when, in Juſtice, he ſhould have been led through all the Country of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and after he had been made a Spectacle to the World, he ought to have been publickly tormented to Death, to rende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Philarchus</hi> exaggerates, with Paſſion, the Calamities of the <hi>Mantinoeans;</hi> as if he thought it the Buſineſs of an Hiſtorian, to pick out and enlarge moſt on the Subject of our Vices; but is ſilent when he ſhould have Recorded the Memorable and Glorious Behaviour of the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd at the ſame time, falſely conceiving that to Regiſter the Flaws and Frailties of Human Nature, were more Eligible, than to Publiſh the Merit of Noble and Generous
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61906:158"/>Actions; while, who knows not, that the Fame and Glory of Noble Deeds, doth more urge us to Vertue, and reform our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners better than the Recital of Criminal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
                     <p>Our Author indeed labouring to ſet forth the Courage of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Enemies, tells us how he took <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolis,</hi> and preſerv'd it from Deſtruction, till he had ſent to <hi>Meſſene,</hi> whither the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were retir'd, to invite them back to their Habitations, and take part with him; nor doth he omit to tell us, that the <hi>Megalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> had hardly the Patience to hear his Letters read, after they knew the Subject, and that they were with difficulty reſtrain'd from ſtoneing the Meſſengers to Death. But he totally neglects to publiſh what in Juſtice, and according to the Rules of Hiſtory, ſhould not have been omitted; namely, to Celebrate the Praiſes of their Vertue, and the generous Reſolution they had taken, which he might fairly have done: For, if we reckon, thoſe Men of Honour and Vertue, who Succour and Defend their Friends and Confederates in Diſtreſs, both in Word and Deed; and if we think it not only Praiſe-worthy, but the Subject of great Rewards, and Conceſſions of remarkable Priviledges to thoſe who ſuffer on that Score, to yield to be ſpoil'd in their Fortunes, to abide the Calamities of Sieges, and endure all the waſtful Effects of Hoſtility;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61906:159"/>what may be then ſaid to be due to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolitans?</hi> Shall we not reckon them Men of Honour? Can we praiſe them too much? Firſt, they indur'd with unſpeakable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, to behold <hi>Cleomenes</hi> Burning and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging all their Territory abroad; then they choſe to abandon their Native City and Soil, rather than their Friendſhip, and the Tyes of Honour they were under to the <hi>Achaians.</hi> In a word, tho' contrary to their Hopes, Overtures were made them, to return to their Poſſeſſions; they could better brook to be depriv'd of their Fortunes, their Sepulchres, their Temples, their Country, their whole Sudſtance, and, in ſhort, to loſe all that was valuable and dear to them, than to Violate their Faith to their Confederates. Could any Man do more? or is it in the Power of any Mortal at any time to acquire a more Glorious and Illuſtrious Character? When, if not here, could an Hiſtorian hope to find a Theme fit to Charm the Attention of the Reader! And what more noble Example could be inculcated to Mankind, to excite them to Conſtancy and Fidelity to their Treaties and Alliances with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States! Nevertheleſs <hi>Philarchus</hi> has committed all this to Oblivion; and therefore I think one may ſafely accuſe him of Stupidity and want of Judgment, in the Choice of ſuch Matter as became the Dignity of Hiſtory, ſince he could
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61906:159"/>neglect the Recording Occurrences of that importance, that lay ſo plainly in his View.</p>
                     <p>We are farther told by our Author, That the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took in Booty from the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> to the value of ſix thouſand Talents, whereof two thouſand, according to ancient Cuſtom, fell to the ſhare of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi> Now, who doth not perceive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Ignorance of this Man, touching the Strength and Poſſeſſions of the <hi>Greek</hi> Towns! which is a matter, wherein, of all things, an Hiſtorian ought to be moſt punctually inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; while I will be bold to aver, without Exaggeration, That it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find the amount of that Sum in all <hi>Peloponneſus, ſetting the Slaves only aſide;</hi> nor do I aſſert it from the Poverty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that had been rob'd and ruin'd by the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings, and more by the mighty Devaſtations of their own Civil Diſſentions; but I am bold to deſcend to the Times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we now behold it, flouriſhing in Union, and rais'd to the greateſt height of Proſperity. In a word, it may be calculated by what I am about to ſay, whether what I undertake to prove be without-book or no. There is ſcarce any Man ſo ignorant, that doth not know, that when the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Thebans</hi> join'd in War againſt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and form'd a Land-army of ten thouſand Men, and a Naval one of one hundred Veſſels, they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61906:160"/>came to a Reſolution, each one to contribute to the Charge of the War, in proportion to his Riches and Poſſeſſions, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an Eſtimate and Valuation was made of all that was appraiſable throughout the <hi>Attick</hi> Territory, comprehending Lands, Buildings, Goods, Treaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and upon that Calculation, the whole Value amounted to two hundred and fifty Talents ſhort of ſix Thouſand; from whence it may be inferr'd, whether we have reaſon or no to ſay what has been obſerv'd touching <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> To conclude, whoſoever ſhould undertake to ſay, that the Pillage and Booty of <hi>Megalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> could exceed, at that time, the Sum of three hundred Talents, would ſurpaſs the Truth of the Account: For we are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, there was a great number, both of People of Free-condition and Slaves, who eſcap'd to <hi>Meſſene;</hi> and what farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this Opinion, that there was no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all <hi>Arcadia,</hi> the <hi>Mantinoeans</hi> excepted, that ſurpaſs'd the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> either in the number of Inhabitants, Strength, or Riches, which <hi>Phylarchus</hi> himſelf grants: and upon the taking the Town after the Siege, out of which no Body could eſcape, or ſecure any thing from the Enemy, there was not rais'd three hundred Talents of the Booty, adding the Sale of the Priſoners to the Account.</p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:61906:160"/>
                     <p>And who will not yet farther wonder, at what <hi>Phylarchus</hi> reports; namely, that about ten Days before the Battel, there arriv'd an Ambaſſadour from <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> to let him know, That he could expect no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Supplies of Mony from him; with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice moreover to come to a ſpeedy Accord with <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and that thereupon <hi>Cleomenes</hi> determin'd to come the more ſpeedily to a Battel, before his Army ſhould have notice of this News, as deſpairing to be able to pay them out of his own Treaſure. Now it is remarkable, that if it were true, that about that very time <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was Maſter of ſix thouſand Talents, he had been in no need of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Aſſiſtance, being a much weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier Prince than himſelf: and, as to what concern'd his Affairs with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> if it were likewiſe probable, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had made but the Sum of three thouſand Talents of the Booty, it would have amounted to more than enough to proſecute the War without danger or difficulty. Is not this then a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance of the Weakneſs and want of Judgment of our Hiſtorian, to ſay, that <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> depended intirely on the Aids and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and to report him at the ſame time Maſter of ſo plentiful a Treaſure! He runs into many the like Errors, in the courſe of his Hiſtory, but what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted may ſuffice for our preſent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:61906:161"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Megalopolis</hi> being taken while <hi>Antigonus</hi> was at <hi>Argos,</hi> where he made his Winter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode; <hi>Cleomenes</hi> aſſembled his Troops ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Spring, and after he had incourag'd them ſutably to the Time and the Occaſion, he took the Field, and fell on the Frontiers of the <hi>Argians,</hi> with a Reſolution, by the Vulgar accounted temerarious, by reaſon of the Strength and difficult Situation of many Places that commanded his paſſage; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgment of thoſe who could beſt diſcern, with Wiſdom and Conduct e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; for, in ſhort, he knew that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> were yet at home, and from them there was no danger to be apprehended in his Enterpriſe. Furthermore, he wiſely conſider'd, that as ſoon as he ſhould have made any Progreſs upon the <hi>Argians,</hi> and had ſpoil'd and ravag'd their Country up to the Walls of the City, that People would not be able, with any Patience, to ſuffer it, but would ſoon trouble <hi>Antigonus</hi> with their Complaints and Remonſtrances; and in caſe that Prince ſhould be mov'd by their Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to take the Field, with thoſe few Troops he had with him, and attempt a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, that it was then odds but he would be beaten; or, if he did not yield to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, but kept within the Walls, that then <hi>Cleomenes</hi> would have the opportunity of terrifying and doing damage to the Enemy, of heartning, and giving Aſſurance to his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61906:161"/>Soldiers, and ſo to return home again with Impunity. And, in ſhort, it happen'd as he had forecaſt, for the <hi>Argians</hi> could not behold their Country waſted and plunder'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſſing <hi>Antigonus</hi> with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; who, notwihſtanding, departed not from the Dignity of a great Prince, and the Rules of a wiſe General. He was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mov'd to take the Field out of fear of preſent Blame, but kept himſelf in Covert, to avoid future Cenſure, and only employ'd his time in expoſing and inculcating his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for all his Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had waſted and pillag'd the Country as he had propos'd; diſhearten'd the Enemy, and confirm'd the Courage of his own People againſt the Danger that threaten'd them, he return'd home in ſafety. In the beginning of Summer, <hi>Antigonus</hi> with the <hi>Mecedonians, Achaians,</hi> and the reſt of the Confederates, led their Troops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Laconia;</hi> their Army conſiſting of ten thouſand <hi>Macedonians</hi> which compos'd the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> three thouſand with Bucklers, three hundred Horſe, and three thouſand choice <hi>Achaian</hi> Foot, three hundred <hi>Achaian</hi> Horſe, and a thouſand <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> arm'd after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> manner, led by <hi>Cercidas</hi> of the ſame Country. There were further Succours of the Allies, conſiſting of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and two hundred Horſe of the <hi>Beotians,</hi> and of the <hi>Epirots</hi> a thouſand Foot
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61906:162"/>and fifty Horſe, and the like number of <hi>Acar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanians,</hi> beſides ſixteen hundred <hi>Illyrians,</hi> commanded by <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Pharian:</hi> So that the Army conſiſted of Twenty eight thouſand Foot, and twelve hundred Horſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> not doubting but the Enemy would ſoon viſit him, took care to ſtrengthen all the Paſſes with good Garriſons, fortifying all the Avenues with Ditches and Ramparts; and filling up, and barricadoing the Ways with great Trees laid a-croſs, fell'd for that purpoſe. As for <hi>Cleomenes</hi> himſelf, he march'd with an Army of twenty thouſand Men, and incamp'd at a certain place call'd <hi>Selaſia,</hi> having reaſon to ſuſpect, that the Enemy purpos'd to paſs that way, and he was not deceiv'd in his Conjecture. Here are ſituate two Mountains, the one call'd <hi>Eva,</hi> the other <hi>Olympus;</hi> between theſe runs the River <hi>Oenus,</hi> along the Banks whereof there is a narrow Way or Defile, that leads to the City of <hi>Sparta. Cleomenes</hi> order'd a good Ditch to be made at the Foot of theſe two Hills, with ſtrong Ramparts behind them; on the Mountain <hi>Eva</hi> he poſted the Forces of the Confederates, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Euclidas</hi> his Brother, and he himſelf poſſeſs'd <hi>Olympus</hi> with the <hi>Spartan</hi> Troops and the Mercenaries In ſhort, his Horſe he appointad to be drawn up in plain Ground near the River on each ſide, ſuſtain'd by a Body of Mercenary Foot.</p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:61906:162"/>
                     <p>When <hi>Antigonus</hi> arriv'd, and had well conſider'd the Situation of the Ground, the Fortifications and Defences that were made, and had remark'd with how much Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had provided for all things, having diſtributed his Troops and poſted them ſo properly, and that he had ſo Soldier-like poſſeſs'd the Place, and was incamp'd in ſuch excellent Order, the Form thereof bearing the reſemblance of an Army drawn up in Order of Battel; for he had omitted no Skill or Forecaſt, either with reſpect to giving the Attack, or receiving the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, his People being in a Poſture for either, and his Camp well ſecur'd againſt any Inſult or Surprize.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Antigonus,</hi> I ſay, had obſerv'd all this, he could not determine to give <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> Battel, but contented himſelf for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to retire ſome ſmall diſtance off, and incamp his Army on the the River <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gylus,</hi> which fortify'd one part of his Camp. Here he remain'd ſome Days, the better to acquaint himſelf with the Ground and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Country, and the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Enemy; feigning to Attack them now in one place, now in another, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round them to give them the greater Terrour. But perceiving every Poſt to be well-gaurded, and not being able to find any one place, that might incourage him to attempt them; <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being vigilant:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61906:163"/>and warily watching his Motions, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent at every place of importance; he then chang'd his Purpoſe, till at length the two Generals came to agree to joyn Battel: For it was bruited about, That Fortune had made choice of theſe two Great Men, equal in Skill and Bravery, to try the Maſtery one againſt the other. <hi>Antigonus</hi> order'd the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who carried Bucklers of Braſs (mingling among them the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Cohorts) to march againſt thoſe on Mount <hi>Eva;</hi> theſe were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Alexander</hi> Son of <hi>Acmetus,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Pharian,</hi> in the Rear of theſe he rang'd the <hi>Cretians</hi> and <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> who were follow'd by a Body of Reſerve conſiſting of two thouſand <hi>Achaians.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River he order'd the Horſe, who were to ingage thoſe of the Enemy, under the Command of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and on the Wings of the Horſe he appointed a thouſand <hi>Achaians,</hi> and as many <hi>Megalopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans,</hi> while he himſelf reſolv'd to attack <hi>Olympus</hi> at the Head of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and Mercinaries, knowing that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was there; he order'd the Mercenaries to have the Van, and the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx to ſuſtain them, following-by Platton's, whereunto they were compell'd through the difficulties of the Ground; the <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who paſs'd the River <hi>Gorgylus</hi> over Night, and were poſted at the Foot of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61906:163"/>the Mountain, were order'd to begin the Battel, for which they were to receive a Signal by a White Flag, that ſhould be ſpread from the neareſt Poſt they had to <hi>Olympus;</hi> and the Signal that was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> and the Horſe, was a Purple Caſſock or Coat, which was to be wav'd in the Air, where <hi>Antigonus</hi> himſelf was poſted.</p>
                     <p>When all things were in a readineſs, the Signal was given to the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and after they had incourag'd each other, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd towards the Enemy, and began to aſcend the Mountain, while the Foot which <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had mingled with the Horſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the <hi>Achaian</hi> Cohorts were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd with no Reſerve, or Troops to ſuſtain them, advanc'd preſently upon them, and charg'd them in Flank, and much gall'd thoſe who were endeavouring to gain the Mountain; at the ſame time <hi>Euclidas,</hi> who was poſted on the top of the Hill, preſs'd them in Front, and the Mercinaries warmly attack'd their Rear. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> a <hi>Megalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,</hi> obſerving this Diſorder, preſently conceiv'd what would be the Iſſue, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he told his Opinion to the Commanders in Chief, of the Danger theſe Troops were in, but obſerving they gave no heed to his Advice, being then but Young, and having never yet born any Command; he therefore, after he had incourag'd his Country Men,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61906:164"/>attack'd with incredible Bravery the Enemies Horſe. This Action forc'd the Mercinaries, who had fallen on the <hi>Illyrians</hi> Flank to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their Relief, which was their proper Poſt; who obſerving them to be now ingag'd, and retreating from thoſe whom they had before attack'd, haſtned to ſuſtain them; by which means the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and all thoſe who were marching up the Mountain, were deliver'd from the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that retarded their Motion, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely advanc'd on the Enemy; and it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appear'd, that their Succeſs againſt <hi>Euclidas,</hi> was owing to <hi>Philopoemen.</hi> And it is reported, that after the Battel, <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the better to try <hi>Alexander,</hi> ask'd him, How it came to paſs, that he adventur'd to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage before he receiv'd the Signal? and that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould reply, It was not by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that a certain young Man of <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis</hi> had been the occaſion, without any Direction from him. And that <hi>Antigonus</hi> reply'd thereupon, That that young Man had judg'd rightly of the occaſion of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and had done the part of a good Captain, and that <hi>Alexander</hi> had acted like a young Soldier. And now <hi>Euclidas</hi> obſerving the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Cohorts to approach, forgot as one may ſay the advantage of the Ground where he was poſted; for it is the Rule of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Leaders, when they are poſted on ſuperior Ground to the Enemy, to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61906:164"/>them, and improve the advantage of the Shock, that the deſcent of the Hill lends them, thereby to give the greater Terrour to the Enemy, and then, if Neceſſity obliges them, ſlowly to retire and gain the ſummet of the Hill; for by diſordering thus the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and depriving them of the advantage they promis'd themſelves by their different ſort of Arms, and the Order in which they march'd, it would not have been hard for him to have forc'd them down the Hill, ſo commodiouſly poſted as he was. But <hi>Euclidas</hi> perform'd nothing of all this, but acted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly contrary; and as if to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all would conduce to the Victory, he remain'd on the top of the Hill where he was firſt poſted; imagining it to be his Duty there to attend the coming of the Enemy, to the end, that when he ſhould have defeated them, they might be the more intangled and obſtructed in their Flight, by reaſon of the Precipices and the broken Ground of the Mountain. But it happen'd quite otherwiſe than he had conjectur'd, for while he had ſo plac'd himſelf that he had left no room behind him to retire, he found himſelf oblig'd to fight and defend himſelf on the top of the Hill againſt the intire unbroken Body of the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Cohorts, whom he had permitted to gain the top, and were now advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him on level Ground, ſo that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an eaſie Conqueſt to the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61906:165"/>no Ground whereon to make an orderly Retreat, all behind him being Rocks and Precipices.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Horſe were warmly ingag'd, where the <hi>Achaians</hi> perform'd all that could be look'd for in the like occaſion, for they knew this Battel did as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide their Liberty; but <hi>Philopoemen</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable above all the reſt, whoſe Horſe being firſt kill'd under him, and afterward fighting among the Foot, he was there ſtruck through both his thighs at one ſtroke. On the other-ſide, the two Princes began the Battel on Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> with their light-arm'd Soldiers and their Mercenaries, conſiſting of about five Thouſand on each part. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they fought by Parties, and then again encountred with groſs Bodies, but with great Reſolution on both ſides, the Action being under the Eye of their Maſters, and in View of both Armies; ſometimes they mingled and fought Man to Man, and then Troop againſt Troop, but howſoever it happen'd, they fought with wonderful Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>During this variety of Action, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> receiv'd notice, that his Brother was beaten out of the Field, and that the Horſe that fought in the Plain began to give Ground, ſo that fearing to be incompaſs'd by the Enemy on all ſides, he was conſtrain'd to level and open his Retrenchments before his Camp, and to order all his Troops to march out in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61906:165"/>Front. And the Trumpets ſounding to the Charge on both ſides, he order'd his light arm'd Soldiers to retire, and now the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanxes on either ſide mov'd to the Encounter with their Pikes charg'd; and one while the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſeem'd inferiour in Courage to the <hi>Lacedemoniaus,</hi> and appear'd diſpos'd to fly; then again the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſeem'd too weak to ſuſtain the Shock of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanx, and were giving Ground. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>Antigonus</hi> now advancing againſt them with an Impetuoſity peculiar to the double Phalanx, forc'd the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> at length off their Ground; the reſt of the Army either fell in Battel, or ſav'd themſelves by Flight, and <hi>Cleomines</hi> with a ſmall Party of Horſe, eſcap'd unhurt to <hi>Sparta;</hi> from whence he departed the Night following to <hi>Gythia,</hi> where he imbark'd on certain Veſſels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for ſuch an Incident, and ſail'd to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indria,</hi> accompany'd with ſome few only of his intimate Friends.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, <hi>Antigonus</hi> made his Entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sparta</hi> without reſiſtance, where he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> with all poſſible Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and as ſoon as he had Re-eſtabliſh'd their Ancient Form of Government, he march'd away with his Army; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Intelligence, That the <hi>Illyrians</hi> had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and made great Spoils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Country. Thus it is true, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is pleas'd ſometimes to permit Actions
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61906:166"/>of higheſt Conſequence, to move and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on the ſlendreſt Accidents, and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions leaſt expected. For, if <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had reſpited coming to a Battel but a few Days only; or when he had retir'd to the City af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fight, had he but ſtood upon his Guard, and temporis'd never ſo little, he moſt certainly had preſerv'd his Dominion. In ſhort, <hi>Antigonus</hi> took his way by <hi>Tegea,</hi> and after he had reſtor'd that Republick, he came two Days after to <hi>Argos,</hi> at the time of the <hi>Namoean</hi> Games, where he obtain'd by an Ordinance of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and by the Suffrage of every City, all thoſe Honours that are done to Great Men to render their Fame immortal: From thence he proceeded by long Journies to <hi>Macedon,</hi> where encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> who were waſting the Country, he gave them Battel, and wan a Victory, but in that occaſion ſtraining his Voice to Animate his People, he broke ſome Vein in his Lungs, whereby voiding Blood at his Mouth, he fell into a Languor, and evil Habit of Health, which ſoon after took him out of the World.

                     <p>And now, if it be ask'd, why we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd thus long on the Hiſtory of the <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menic</hi> War? I anſwer, Becauſe it occur'd in a Period of Time, that confines on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Affairs and Adventures, that are to be the Subject of our Hiſtory; and we conceiv'd it was not uſeful only, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to ſet down the then State of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Affairs, eſpecially ſince we have reſolv'd to perform punctually what we have promis'd. About the ſame time died <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to whom ſucceeded that other <hi>Ptolomy</hi> Surnam'd <hi>Philopater. Seleucus</hi> who was Surnam'd <hi>Pogon,</hi> Son to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and Grand-ſon to <hi>Calinychus,</hi> died likewiſe near that Time, whoſe Succeſſour in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Syria,</hi> was his Brother <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus;</hi> thus died thoſe who ſucceeded <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> namely, <hi>Seleucus, Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> all within the Hundred and twenty fourth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as did the others in the Hundred and thirty ninth.</p>

                     <p>VVE promis'd in our Firſt Book to begin our Hiſtory at the Second <hi>Punick</hi> War; the War of the Confederates; and that which was wag'd for the Dominion of <hi>Syria.</hi> We have likewiſe deliver'd our Reaſons, why in our two preceeding Books we deduc'd and brought down our Story
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61906:168"/>from ſo remote Times. Now we are come to treat of the Wars themſelves, and the Cauſes that begat and prolong'd them, and that render'd them ſo terrible. But firſt it will be neceſſary that we preface ſomething farther touching our purpoſe, for ſince what we have determin'd to deliver, is propos'd to center in one and the ſame End, being to be but one entire Work, and as one may ſay one Spectacle or Repreſentation, where will be ſeen how, when, and by what means, all the known Parts of the World, became reduc'd under the Dominion of the <hi>Romans;</hi> we have therefore concluded it not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our Method, to give a previous Draught, as it were in little, of what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd of Importance during ſo many and great Wars; conceiving the Reader will be thereby more enlighten'd, and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in our main Deſign. For as the knowledge of the whole cannot but yield ſome conception of the Parts; and that to be rightly inform'd of the parts, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enable us to judge better of the whole; we ſhall therefore purſue this courſe, which we have judg'd the moſt proper for Inſtruction, in opening what might elſe ſeem obſcure; and ſhall produce a Table, as it were, or Index, of our whole Hiſtory, where will be review'd what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. We have indeed already given a kind of Summary of our intire Work, and have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61906:168"/>preſcrib'd its bounds; but for the particular Occurrences, as the Wars, (whereof we have already made recital) will be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; ſo we ſhall preſcribe its Period with the deſolation and extinction of the Royal Houſe of <hi>Macedon.</hi> In brief, it will be the Adventures only of Three and fifty Years, in which ſpace will be ſound Occurrences ſo numerous and extraordinary, that no Age within the ſame compaſs of Time hath ſhown the like. Our beginning ſhall be at the hundred and fortieth Olympiad, and the Order we purpoſe to obſerve will be as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>When we have opened the Reaſons that gave original to the War between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> call'd the War of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> we ſhall ſhow how, and by what means, the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> after their Invaſion of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Suppreſſion almoſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion there, reduc'd them at length to that low ebb of Fortune, as to raiſe their hopes of becoming Maſters of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf: Then we ſhall endeavour to explain how at the ſame time <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> when he had ended his Wars with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and eſtabliſh'd afterwards Peace among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> enter'd into Confederacy with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> About the ſame time began the Conteſt between <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy Philopater,</hi> touching the Dominion of the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> which came at length to a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61906:169"/>War. The <hi>Rhodians</hi> and <hi>Pruſias</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at that time in Hoſtility with thoſe of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and hinder'd the levying the cuſtomary Duty that was paid them by thoſe who traded into the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea. Here we ſhall reſpite our Diſcourſe, to begin our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Romans;</hi> of whom we ſhall endeavour to ſhow by the Events, that their Form of Government did not only greatly avail towards their recovery of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>Sicily,</hi> together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> under their Dominion; but (after they had ſubdu'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>) to inſpire them with Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to atchieve the Conqueſt of the World. We ſhall likewiſe by a ſhort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion relate how the Dominion of <hi>Hieron</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was loſt. Then we ſhall ſay ſomething of the Diſorders that fell out in <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherein mention ſhall be made of the Conſpiracy that happen'd on the Death of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> to divide that Kingdom, which was left to his Son, then a Child. And ſhall further obſerve after what manner <hi>Philip,</hi> between Craft and Force, attempted at once the Kingdoms of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> the <hi>Lower Syria</hi> and <hi>Phaenicia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, we ſhall then give an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what paſs'd between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Spain, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> and then we ſhall treat of Occurrences among
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61906:169"/>the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and make mention of ſuch Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions as have any regard to that People. But after we ſhall have diſcours'd of the Naval War between <hi>Attalus,</hi> in conjunction with the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> and that which was wag'd between <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſhall have ſhewn after what manner the War was conducted, and by whoſe management, and what the Succeſs was; we ſhall then purſue the Relation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſucceſſion of Occurrences, and ſhall make mention of the Motives the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had to invite and draw <hi>Antiochus</hi> out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereby they became the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the War that follow'd between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Achaians;</hi> whereof when we have obſerv'd what were the Cauſes, and have ſeen <hi>Antiochus</hi> landed in <hi>Europe,</hi> we ſhall then firſt ſhew how he was driven out of <hi>Greece,</hi> and afterwards (being vanquiſh'd in Battel) how he deſerted all he poſſeſs'd in <hi>Aſia</hi> on this ſide Mount <hi>Taurus;</hi> and then, how the <hi>Romans,</hi> having repreſs'd the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> acquir'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Dominion, but deliver'd however the People of the <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> from the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Terrors and Injuries of thoſe Barbarians. Then ſhall be related the Calamities of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Cephalenia,</hi> to which will ſucceed the Account of the War between <hi>Eumenes</hi> and <hi>Pruſias,</hi> in conjunction with the <hi>Gollo-Graecians;</hi> to which ſhall be added,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61906:170"/>that which the ſame <hi>Eumenes,</hi> join'd with <hi>Ariarathes,</hi> wag'd againſt <hi>Pharnaces.</hi> And after we have made mention of the union of thoſe of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and of the growth of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Commonwealth, we ſhall then make a recapitulation of our whole Hiſtory, as we have already propos'd. Nor ſhall we omit to relate the Expedition of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> nor the <hi>Perſian</hi> War; nor the Deſtruction of the Royal Houſe of <hi>Macedon.</hi> In a word, Theſe Occurrences when duly weigh'd, will evidence by what Order and Method of Conduct, the <hi>Romans</hi> have acquir'd the Univerſal Dominion.</p>
                     <p>For if the good or evil Succeſs of Affairs, may be the meaſure whereby to make a Judgment of things laudable or worthy of blame, whether it be with reſpect to Perſons, or States; we muſt finiſh our Hiſtory with the Adventures we laſt recited, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the Three and fifty Years we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and ſhews us the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire at its utmoſt growth of Greatneſs: For after this, none were ignorant, and the whole World was compell'd to confeſs, that all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was due to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſubjection to their Laws.</p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as we cannot make a clear Judgment either of the Victors or the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, by a bare Account of Events, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſometimes things have become hurtful, which had they been rightly improv'd, might
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61906:170"/>have been profitable; and, on the other hand, ſome by their Vertue and Conſtancy, have turn'd even their Misfortunes to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; we have therefore judg'd it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to ſubjoin to what we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to deliver, an Account of the Manners and Diſcipline of the Conquerors, after what ſort they improv'd their Victories, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the World had of them, and of their Laws and Cuſtoms in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government. Furthermore, we ſhall make enquiry into the Paſſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations which prevail'd among each Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſpectively, with regard to publick and private Ends; ſo that thoſe of the preſent Age will be able thereby to diſcern, whether they ought to ſhun or chuſe ſubjection to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and Poſterity to judge, whether their Government were worthy of praiſe and imitation, or to be rejected as vicious and blameable; for in that we propoſe eſpecially to conſiſt the Utility of our Hiſtory to the preſent and future Ages.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, this we ought to believe, that thoſe who have the Conduct in Tranſactions of War, and thoſe who are concern'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Adminiſtration of publick Affairs, do not propoſe Victory, and the ſurmounting the Difficulties that occurr in their Attempts, as the ſingle and ultimate end of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: For no wiſe Man ever made War bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſake of vanquiſhing his Enemy;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61906:171"/>nor did any ever embark upon the Ocean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would be able to ſay he had croſs'd the Seas; nor do Men ſtudy the Arts and Sciences, for the ſingle motive of being thought skilful therein; but every one hath his proſpect, either of Pleaſure, Honour, or Profit, as the Reward of his Pains and Study: So the principal end we have propos'd in this our Work, is to explain and demonſtrate to the World the State and Condition of Mankind, after all the Nations of the Earth being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were become ſubject to their Laws, till thoſe new Commotions that afterwards fell out. I had alſo a yet further motive which preſs'd me to this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and which affords, as it were, a new beginning; namely, the ſtupendious Occurrences and marvellous Adventures whereby thoſe times were diſtinguiſh'd, and to which moreover I am the more willingly diſpos'd, from my having been a Witneſs and Spectator of many of thoſe great Actions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving contributed in the execution of ſome, and conducted and principally advis'd in the performance of others. They were thoſe Commotions I mention'd, that obliged the <hi>Romans</hi> to make War on the <hi>Vaccoeans</hi> and <hi>Celtiberians;</hi> which mov'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> to take Arms againſt <hi>Maſſaniſſa,</hi> and <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Pruſias</hi> to declare War with each other in <hi>Aſia.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Ariarathes</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who had been expell'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61906:171"/>his Kingdom by <hi>Orofernes,</hi> was, by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his ſole Forces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to his Government; and then it was that <hi>Seleucus,</hi> Son of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> having reign'd twelve Years in <hi>Syria,</hi> loſt his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and his Life by a Conſpiracy of the neighbouring Princes: The <hi>Greeks,</hi> who ſtood accus'd of having been Authors of the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, were about the ſame time abſolv'd of that Blemiſh, with liberty granted them by the <hi>Romans</hi> to return from Baniſhment to their Country. Shortly after theſe Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>Romans</hi> attempted to compel the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> firſt to remove and change their Habitations, and afterwards totally to ruine and exterminate them. But we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in its proper place the motives of that Enterprize. About the ſame time likewiſe the <hi>Macedonians</hi> departing from their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> from theirs with the <hi>Achaians,</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us, in one proſpect, with the beginning and end of the common Calamities of <hi>Greece,</hi> where will occurr ample matter for the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian's Skill to deſcribe; and it behoves us to implore the favour of Fortune, to lend us life to conduct us through ſo difficult and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Task: Nevertheleſs, tho' Death ſhould chance to prevent us, we ſhould not however depart without ſome aſſurance that our Deſign will ſurvive us, and that there will not want ſome excellent Hand, who,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61906:172"/>charm'd with the Beauty of ſo incomparable a Subject, will ſucceſsfully finiſh what we have begun. And now that we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd the moſt remarkable things, which we thought neceſſary towards the improvement of the Reader's Underſtanding of our Hiſtory, both in the parts and the whole, it is high time we proceed to our Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Whereas thoſe Authors, for the moſt part, who have writ the Acts of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> have undertaken to give us an account of the Cauſes which begat the War that broke out between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention hath been already made, and have render'd the Siege of <hi>Saguntum</hi> to have been the firſt occaſion, and the ſecond to be the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> paſſing the River <hi>Eber,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Articles of Agreement: For my own part, I do frankly agree with them, That theſe were the beginnings of the War, but can never accord with thoſe who reckon them for the Cauſes, no more than it can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s tranſporting his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Aſia,</hi> was the cauſe of the <hi>Perſian</hi> War; or that the Voyage of <hi>Antiochus</hi> to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrias</hi> with his Army, was likewiſe cauſe of the War with that Prince: For who can be drawn eaſily to conceive, that that was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>'s motive for the mighty Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he made, and of thoſe things which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> in his Life-time put in execution before him, in order to the <hi>Perſian</hi> War? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61906:172"/>who will take the beginning of the War, which the <hi>Aetolians</hi> made upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> before the arrival of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to have been the cauſe? Thoſe who reaſon at this rate, ſeem not to diſtinguiſh of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Beginnings, the Cauſes, and the Pretexts. The Cauſes always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Beginnings, which are ever ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and as it were a Conſequence.</p>
                     <p>I hold therefore the Beginnings to be the firſt efforts or effects of Deliberation; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of what hath been with mature Reaſon debated and decreed to be put in execution; but this will be more evident by what I am about to ſay, whereby it will plainly appear, what the Cauſes were which produc'd the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, and where it took beginning. The principal Cauſe was, the retreat the <hi>Greeks</hi> made, by the Conduct of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> through ſo many divers Nations of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Aſia,</hi> where none of all thoſe barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were all Enemies, had the Courage to oppoſe his paſſage in his march through ſo vaſt a Continent. Another cauſe was the Voyage of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he found no Enemy ſo hardy as to withſtand his Enterprizes, from whence he was recall'd by reaſon of ſome Commotions that happen'd in his abſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Greeks.</hi>

                     <p>Hence <hi>Philip</hi> took his meaſures of the <hi>Perſian</hi> weakneſs, and being not ignorant that both himſelf and his People were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Art of War, was incited by the glory and magnificence of the Reward to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in that Enterprize; ſo that after he had acquir'd the general Good-will and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he proceeded to form his Deſign for the Invaſion of <hi>Perſia;</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing his Motives to be no other, than to revenge the Injuries done to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by thoſe of that Nation, and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to make proviſion of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſuſtain and carry on that vaſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. So that we are thus to reckon, that the Cauſes of the <hi>Perſian</hi>-War were no others than thoſe we firſt mention'd, the Pretexts what we have recited, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be <hi>Alexander</hi>'s tranſporting his Troops into <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe paſt diſpute, that the diſtaſte the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had conceiv'd againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> was the cauſe of the War that broke out betwixt <hi>Antiochus</hi> and Them. For the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> towards the end of the War with <hi>Philip,</hi> beginning to perceive themſelves ſlighted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> did not only invite over <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as we have noted, but deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to do and ſuffer any thing to compaſs their Revenge. The Pretext for that War was the Liberty of <hi>Greece,</hi> to the defence whereof the <hi>Aetolians</hi> drew the <hi>Greeks</hi> from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61906:173"/>all parts to joyn with <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of that Prince at the head of an Army to <hi>Demetrias,</hi> was the beginning of the War.</p>
                     <p>I have reſted the longer on this ſubject, of ſhowing the difference between theſe three Points, not only to detect the Errors of ſome Hiſtorians; but to the end the ſtudious may be inſtructed and ſet right, in caſe they ſhould be miſlead by their falſe Lights. For to what end is the Phyſician call'd to the ſick Patient, if he ſhould be ignorant of the Cauſes of our Diſeaſes? In like manner, it would be in vain to call ſuch to the adminiſtration of Publick Affairs, who want Judgment to diſtinguiſh of the Cauſes, and Reaſons, and Events of things.</p>
                     <p>And there can be no diſpute but both the Phyſician and Miniſter of State will miſcarry, while the one is to ſeek for the Cauſes of our Infirmities, and the other not duly inſtructed in thoſe neceſſary Points we have noted. There is nothing then that calls for more of our care and ſtudy to acquire, than a right knowledge of the Springs and Cauſes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, for very often it fortunes, that the greateſt things are bred out of ſlight begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and Remedies may be found with caſe for Evils in their infancy and firſt approaches.</p>

                        <hi>Fabius</hi> the Hiſtorian reports, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Injuries done to the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> but the Avarice and Ambition of <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> were the cauſe of the War with <hi>Hannibal.</hi> That after
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61906:174"/>
                        <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> had ſtrengthen'd himſelf by his great Power and Acquiſitions in <hi>Spain,</hi> he made a Voyage into <hi>Africk,</hi> where he attempted with all his Might to ſubvert and aboliſh the Laws and Conſtitutions of his Country, and to change the Republick of <hi>Carthage</hi> into a Monarchy; but that the principal Citizens ſuſpecting his Deſign, oppos'd and totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd him, who, after he had vainly urg'd his Project, return'd at length into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he govern'd abſolutely without any regard to the Authority of the Senate of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> and that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who took part in all his Adventures, and purſu'd his ſteps in every thing, did both ſucceed and imitate <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in the Deſign he had form'd; and ſoon after he of his own head declar'd War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> contrary to the inclination of the Senate; and that there was not one of any Condition or Authority among the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> who did not diſapprove his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the <hi>Saguntines.</hi> He further adds, That after the taking of that Town, the <hi>Romans</hi> diſpatch'd Ambaſſadors to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> to require the delivering up of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> or on refuſal to declare War againſt them. But now if it ſhould be demanded of <hi>Fabius,</hi> whether the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> could have done a juſter or wiſer thing, than to have comply'd with the demand of the <hi>Romans</hi> in yielding up <hi>Hannibal;</hi> for if, as he ſays, his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings diſpleas'd them, what ſafer or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61906:174"/>courſe could they have taken to be rid of one who ſtood tainted with the Character of a common Enemy to his Country? They had thereby eſtabliſh'd the Security of the State, and by a ſingle Decree of the Senate, deliver'd themſelves from the War which threaten'd them: What now would our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian be able to ſay to all this? certainly he would be greatly to ſeek for an anſwer. But the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were ſo far from ſuch Deliberations, that on the contrary they ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly proſecuted the War, which was begun by the Opinion of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> for the ſpace of ſeventeen Years together; and did not yield to relinquiſh it, till they were quite hopeleſs of ſucceſs, and beheld both their Fortune and Country ſinking</p>
                     <p>But why have I thus enlarg'd on <hi>Fabius</hi> and his Hiſtory? 'Tis not becauſe I conceive it to be written with ſuch a faſhion of Truth, as to fear that ſome one or other might be perſwaded to believe it. For in ſhort, all that he hath deliver'd hath ſo little ſhow of Reaſon or Probability, that without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of mine, it is very eaſie to perceive him a faithleſs Author by the Matter he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers: I would therefore only barely adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the Readers of his Hiſtory, not ſo much to conſult the Title of the Book, as the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of things; for there are thoſe who are more biaſs'd by the Character of a Speaker, than the Matter he delivers; and while they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61906:175"/>reflect that <hi>Fabius</hi> was a Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> and liv'd in theſe times, they conclude that all he ſays, hath the ſtamp of Truth: For my own part, as I will not affirm he ought in every thing to be rejected; ſo I will take the liberty to think we are not to truſt him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our own Eyes. To return therefore to our Diſcourſe; It was the indignation of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car Barcas,</hi> Father of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that ought to be eſteem'd the firſt cauſe of that War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> For after the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War, as it was viſible he loſt nothing of his greatneſs of Mind, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reſolution, by his preſerving the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions under his Command at <hi>Erix</hi> unbroken; and that albeit after the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> defeat at Sea, he was compell'd to diſſemble his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, and yield to a treaty of Peace with the <hi>Romans;</hi> his Anger was not however ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd, and he labour'd after nothing more than to find an occaſion of renewing the War; and had ſoon brought his purpoſe to effect, had not the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> been diverted by the Sedition of their Mercenaries, ſo great was his Authority; but being prevented by by thoſe Commotions, he was conſtrain'd to apply himſelf firſt to compoſe the Diſorders that happen'd in his own Country.</p>
                     <p>After theſe Tumults were over, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> declar'd War againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who readily at firſt embrac'd the occaſion, hoping for Victory from the juſtice of their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61906:175"/>Cauſe, as we have already ſhown. But as the <hi>Romans</hi> has no regard to the Argument of the Quarrel; ſo the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> finding at length it wou'd be their ſafeſt courſe to yield to neceſſity, ſubmitted with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy to deliver up <hi>Sardinia;</hi> and further, to buy off the danger of a War, they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Stipulation, over and above the firſt Tribute, to pay yearly the ſumm of twelve hundred Talents; whereupon it may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon'd, that this Diſgrace became a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the greateſt cauſe of the War that enſu'd. In ſhort, <hi>Hamilcar</hi> perceiving now the Indignation of his Fellow-Citizens to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with his own, that he had appeas'd the Diſorders of his Country, which was now in Tranquility, and the Government eſtabliſh'd, turn'd his Thoughts towards <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence he propos'd to derive Succours, and all ſorts of Aſſiſtance to further his Project of War upon the <hi>Romans.</hi> We are to reckon for the third cauſe of that War, the great ſucceſs of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> by which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforc'd by ſo many Helps and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, they chearfully proſecuted the Deſign. In ſhort, it may be collected by manifold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that <hi>Hamilcar</hi> was the Author of the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War, albeit he liv'd not to the beginning of the enterprize by eight Years, which will be better underſtood by what follows.</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61906:176"/>
                     <p>After <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Defeat by the <hi>Romans,</hi> being conſtrain'd to fly his Country, he made his retreat to the Court of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who foreſaw the purpoſes of the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> diſpatch'd Ambaſſadors to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the better to pry into the Deſigns of that Prince; and after they had diſcover'd that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was determin'd to take part with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and conſequently to ingage in a War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> they thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to viſit and hold Conferences with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> with no other intention than to render him ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>d to <hi>Antiochus;</hi> which Plot ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to their wiſh. And as <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Jealouſies grew every Day greater, they came at length to a mutual opening of each others Mind on the ſubject of the Diffidence that was grown between them, and tho' <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaid much to purge himſelf of the Imputation he lay under; yet perceiving it avail'd little, he came at length to impart to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that when <hi>Hamilcar</hi> went into <hi>Spain</hi> at the head of an Army, he being then about nine Years old, his Father ſacrificing for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Voyage, after the Ceremony was ended, and he had perform'd all the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Rites practis'd on thoſe occaſions, he caus'd the reſt of the Company to withdraw; and making him approach to the Altar, he there gently demanded of him, If he were inclin'd to accompany him in his Voyage to <hi>Spain?</hi> To which he joyfully reply'd, That
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61906:176"/>he would go moſt willingly: And after he had beſought him with all the moving Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which a Child was capable to urge, that he would take him with him, his Father then taking him by the Hand, led him to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; where he made him ſwear on the ſame Altar, That he would never be in Friendſhip with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore he beſought <hi>Antiochus</hi> to reſt aſſured, That he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change his Sentiments towards that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that if he had determin'd any thing againſt them, that he would make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to rely on his Secreſie and Fidelity; and that he would ſerve him with joy and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But that if he ſhould enter into Terms of Friendſhip and Alliance with the <hi>Romans,</hi> there ſhould be no need of ſuggeſting Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt him, who would himſelf be the firſt that ſhould declare his Averſion to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who in ſuch caſe would have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hold him as an Enemy; foraſmuch as he could never be other than a mortal Foe to the <hi>Romans,</hi> againſt whom he would attempt all things to the utmoſt of his power.</p>
                     <p>By this Diſcourſe of <hi>Hannibal, Antiochus</hi> perceiving he ſpoke from his Heart, was cur'd of the Jealouſie he had conceiv'd of him.</p>
                     <p>Behold here a ſingular Inſtance of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> and of the Determination he had taken, which was yet made more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by the effects: For he bequeath'd two
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61906:177"/>ſuch Enemies to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> his Son-in-Law, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> his Son, as nothing could be thought to ſurmount their Hatred. But <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> liv'd not to put his Purpoſes in execution, while <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd to wreak abundantly the Averſion he had inherited from his Father. Which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes ſafe Advice to thoſe who have the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Publick Affairs, to conſult carefully the Minds and Motives of thoſe with whom they treat a Reconciliation, or with whom they make a new Friendſhip; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by force or neceſſity of the Times, or an effect of Good-will, as weary of Hoſtility: For againſt the one we are to be carefully on our guard, as being ſuch who only attend the Advantage of a new Occaſion, while we may rely with aſſurance on the others, and treat them with the ſincerity of Subjects or of Friends.</p>
                     <p>We may juſtly then eſteem theſe for the Cauſes of the War made by <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and the Beginnings to be what we ſhall now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliver. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had deeply reſented their loſs of <hi>Sicily;</hi> but after they had been compell'd to part with <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and to pay the heavy Tribute they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, their Hatred grew to exceſs, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when they had augmented their Dominion, by the Conqueſt of ſo great a part of <hi>Spain,</hi> they began to lend a more willing ear to the Clamours every where ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61906:177"/>againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> In the mean time they loſt <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> to whom, after the Death of <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> they had given the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> upon the death of <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> remain'd a while in ſuſpence, touching their choice of a new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, being willing to ſound firſt the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Army; but they no ſooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the Soldiers had unanimouſly made choice of <hi>Hannibal</hi> for their Leader, when they forthwith call'd an Aſſembly, and ratify'd with one Voice the Suffrages of the Soldiers. Soon after <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s confirmation in his Government, he deliberated on redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Olcades</hi> under the Dominion of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> purſuant to which Deſign, he march'd againſt the City of <hi>Althaea,</hi> a rich and well-fortify'd Place, and ſat down before it; in which Siege he gave ſo many Marks of his Bravery and Ability, that he ſoon became Maſter of the Place; where his Succeſs ſo terrify'd the neighbouring Towns, that they readily yielded themſelves up to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi> After he had amaſſ'd much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by the ſale of the Booty he had taken in the ſeveral Towns, he march'd to <hi>New-Carthage,</hi> which he made his Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; where he expreſs'd great Generoſity to thoſe who had ſerv'd under him; and paying the Soldiers their Arrears, and promiſing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Marks of his Bounty, he ſo won upon the Affections of the Army, that they had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61906:178"/>already conceiv'd extraordinary hopes of his Government.</p>
                     <p>Early the next Spring he march'd againſt the <hi>Vaccoeans,</hi> and ſoon became Maſter of <hi>Salmantica:</hi> Then he beſieg'd <hi>Arbucala;</hi> which Place being great, well-peopl'd, and the Inhabitants obſtinate in their defence, gave him much trouble; but in the end tho Town was ſurrender'd; but on his return be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attack'd by the <hi>Carpetanians,</hi> a People reckon'd among the moſt powerful of thoſe Nations, he became on the ſudden reduc'd to very great ſtraits; for theſe being join'd by thoſe of the neighbouring Provinces, whom the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But he, who was ſingular both in Prudence and Dexterity, ſo artfully made his retreat (covering himſelf by the <hi>Tagus</hi>) and contriv'd ſo to attack them in their paſſage over that River, that what by the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the ſervice of forty Elephants he had with him, he happily effected what he had deſign'd, when every body was in deſpair. In ſhort, the Enemy being determin'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their utmoſt, reſolv'd to paſs the River by ſeveral Fords at once; but being encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by the Elephants, which were poſted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61906:178"/>along the Banks for that ſervice, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were ſlain as they came to Land, before any could come in to their ſuccour; many were likewiſe cut off by the Horſe, who min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the River with the Enemy, where, by the ſtrength of their Horſes, which better reſiſted the Current than the Foot, and ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a higher place, they had much the advantage. In a word, <hi>Hannibal</hi> at length paſs'd the River himſelf; and vigorouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his ſucceſs, routed an Army of above an hundred thouſand of theſe Barbarians; who being thus defeated, there remain'd none on that ſide the River <hi>Eber,</hi> except the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntines,</hi> that could give him any moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> cautiouſly abſtain'd from any the leaſt Hoſtility againſt that People, purſuant to the Advice of <hi>Aſdrubal;</hi> which was, To make himſelf firſt Maſter of the reſt of the Country, and inſure his Conqueſts there, before he gave occaſion openly to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to declare War againſt the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Saguntines</hi> diſpatch'd frequent Advices to the <hi>Romans,</hi> led thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to partly out of fear and foreſight of their own impending Danger, partly likewiſe out of Good-will, to the end the <hi>Romans</hi> might be perfectly inſtructed in the Succeſſes of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> In ſhort, after a cold reception of many of theſe Intimations, they determin'd at length to diſpatch Ambaſſadors
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61906:179"/>into <hi>Spain,</hi> to be eye-witneſſes of thoſe things whereof they had been inform'd. About which time <hi>Hannibal,</hi> having ſubdu'd all thoſe People which he had purpos'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, was march'd to <hi>New-Carthage</hi> to his Winter-Quarters, that Place being as it were the Capital City of thoſe Countries, that yielded Obedience to the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> There he found the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſadors; and giving them audience, was by them caution'd to attempt nothing againſt the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> who were receiv'd into the protection of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that purſuant to the Treaty made with <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> they ſhould not paſs their Troops beyond the River <hi>Eber.</hi> To this <hi>Hannibal</hi> (who was yet but young, and ardently ambitious of military Glory, fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his Enterprizes, and mortally hating the <hi>Romans</hi>) reply'd by way of complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, feigning to favour thoſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum,</hi> and telling the Ambaſſadors, That upon a certain Sedition that happen'd ſome time ago in the ſaid City, that the <hi>Romans</hi> being choſen to arbitrate their Differences, and to reduce the Citizens to Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had unjuſtly animadverted on certain of the principal Inhabitants; which perfidious Action of theirs, he held himſelf oblig'd to ſee reveng'd; and that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited that Cuſtom from their Anceſtors, to procure Juſtice to be done to the Oppreſs'd.

Thus <hi>Hannibal,</hi> tranſported by a violent Hatred, acted in every thing without conſulting his Reaſon, and never troubling himſelf with the truth of Matters, founded Pretexts on falſe Suggeſtions; after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thoſe, who, prepoſſeſs'd by their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, do what they have determin'd, without regard to Equity, or conſideration of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Otherwiſe, had it not been more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have demanded of the <hi>Romans</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and the Money ſo long paid them by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which they had wrung from them during the Weakneſs and Calamities of the Republick; and in caſe of refuſal, to declare War againſt them? But as he conceal'd the true Cauſe, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to falſe Reaſons for his Motive, it may be very juſtly ſuſpected he enter'd into that War, not only without Reaſon, but againſt the Common Right of Nations.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Ambaſſadors departing, went to <hi>Carthage,</hi> there to expoſtulate about what had already paſt; albeit, now well aſſur'd, that War would enſue, tho' without any jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie it would break out in <hi>Italy,</hi> but in <hi>Spain</hi> rather, and that <hi>Saguntum</hi> would be as it were the Seat of Action; which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd as a proper Fortreſs and Place of Arms:

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> then reſolv'd to pillage and reduce the Towns of <hi>Illyria</hi> under his Dominion, which were now in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and having ſail'd beyond <hi>Liſſa</hi> with a Fleet of fifty Ships, contrary to the Articles of the Treaty, he ravag'd moſt of the Iſlands of the <hi>Cyclades.</hi> So that the <hi>Romans</hi> having notice of theſe Infractions, and being over and above well inform'd of the preſent Proſperity of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> concluded that it behov'd them to have a careful Eye to their Affairs in the Provinces Eaſtward of <hi>Italy:</hi> Nor were they without hopes of defeating the Deſigns of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> of making the <hi>Illyrians</hi> to repent their Folly, and puniſhing the Perfidy and raſh Behaviour of <hi>Demetrius.</hi> But theſe prov'd vain Deliberations, for <hi>Hannibal</hi> was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61906:180"/>too much in earneſt and prevented them, and in the mean time became Maſter of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> which Succeſs was the cauſe that they were not only oblig'd to make War in <hi>Spain,</hi> but in <hi>Italy,</hi> for the defence of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Howbeit the <hi>Romans,</hi> purſuant to their firſt Project, ſent <hi>Lucius Aemilius</hi> into <hi>Illyria</hi> with an Army early in the Spring, being in the firſt Year of the hundred and fortieth Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, at which time <hi>Hannibal</hi> parted with his Army from New <hi>Carthage</hi> towards <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This City is ſituate about a Mile from the Sea, at the foot of thoſe Mountains which part <hi>Spain</hi> from <hi>Celtiberia.</hi> The Territory of <hi>Saguntum</hi> is very fertile, abounding in all ſorts of excellent Fruits, wherein no part of <hi>Spain</hi> exceeds it. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſits down before it, and attacks it with ſo much the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, by how much he judg'd the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſuch a Place by plain force, would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avail towards his compaſſing thoſe Ends he had further meditated. In a word, he conceiv'd he ſhould by that means deprive the <hi>Romans</hi> of all hope of making War in <hi>Spain;</hi> and further, made account, that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd by his Succeſs, thoſe he had already vanquiſh'd, would be thereby held in better Obedience, and preſerve their Faith unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that thoſe who were yet unconquer'd would ſtand in greater awe of his Power; and what was yet of greater conſequence, he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61906:181"/>ſhould be able to advance his Enterprizes with more ſecurity, having no Enemy at his back. Furthermore he calculated, that the taking of this Town would yield him great Supplies of Treaſure for carrying on the War; that his Army would be more at his Devotion, when he had enrich'd them with Booty; and that he ſhould be enabled the better to purchaſe and eſtabliſh his Intereſt among the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> by diſtributing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the Spoils of the Vanquiſh'd. Theſe Reflections incited his Induſtry to preſs the Beſieg'd with greater Application; ſo that becoming himſelf an Example to the Army, by working in the Trenches among the Soldiers, animating them in Perſon, mingling with them in all Hazards, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly attending the Labours of the Siege, he became in the ſpace of eight Months, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Place. Great Booty was there taken both in Money, Priſoners, and rich Movables. The Treaſure he took to himſelf for the Service of the War he had projected againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> the Priſoners he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Army in proportion to their Merit; and the reſt he diſpatch'd in Preſents to his Friends in <hi>Carthage.</hi> Nor did <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> make a wrong reckoning; for the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were oblig'd, and became more hardy in danger, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were won to conſent more readily to all his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and being himſelf now ſupply'd and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61906:181"/>furniſh'd with whatever he wanted, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted his Enterprizes with greater prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time <hi>Demetrius,</hi> having Intelligence of the <hi>Romans</hi> purpoſe, put with expedition a Garriſon into <hi>Dimalus,</hi> which Place he ſupply'd with Stores of War and all things neceſſary; and after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd in the other Towns all thoſe that were of the contrary Faction, and beſtow'd the Governments on his Creatures, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected five thouſand of the ableſt Men from among his own Subjects, and plac'd them in Garriſon in <hi>Pharus.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul led his Legions into <hi>Illyria,</hi> where receiving intimation of the confidence the Enemy was in of the Safety and Strength of <hi>Dimalus,</hi> and being further advis'd, that the Place had the Reputation of having never yet been taken, he therefore reſolv'd to begin his Campagne there, the better to terrifie and diſcourage the Enemy. After therefore he had exhorted his Army to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves as they ought, and caus'd his Engines and Machines to approach in ſeveral places, he began the Siege, and in ſeven Days ſpace took the Town. This Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity of the <hi>Romans</hi> poſſeſs'd the Enemy with ſo much Fear, that they loſt their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Deputies were immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd from all the Towns round about with Tenders of Submiſſion to the <hi>Romans;</hi> which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61906:182"/>the Conſul receiv'd reſpectively under certain Stipulations, and then made ſail toward <hi>Pharus,</hi> where <hi>Demetrius</hi> then was. But being inform'd that the Place was ſtrongly fortify'd, and that there was a numerous Garriſon of able Men within it, and the Town plentifully furniſh'd with all things needful, he therefore judging the Siege was likely to be a difficult and tedious Work, bethought himſelf of this Stratagem; Arriving with his Army by Night on the Coaſt, he landed moſt of his Troops, with direction to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal themſelves in Woods, and Places proper to hide them from the view of the Enemy, and in the Morning makes ſail towards the next Port with twenty Gallies only, in ſight of the Town; <hi>Demetrius</hi> thereupon obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and contemning their number, marches out of the Town with part of the Garriſon to oppoſe their landing; ſo the Battel began, which was proſecuted with great obſtinacy, Supplies of Men being conſtantly ſent from the Town to ſuſtain their Fellows, inſomuch that at length by degrees the whole Garriſon march'd out; in the mean while the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had landed in the Night, advanc'd, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering themſelves all they could in their march, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ſo ſituate, that it defended it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Town and the Port, whereby they cut off the Enemies retreat to the Town. This being obſerv'd by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he ſoon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61906:182"/>diſingag'd himſelf from thoſe who attempted to land, and after he had rally'd and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his Men, marches to attack the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who had poſted themſelves on the Mountain.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore, ſeeing the <hi>Illyrians</hi> advancing toward them, met and charg'd them with unſpeakable Reſolution, while thoſe that were landed attack'd them in the Rear. Inſomuch as finding themſelves thus hard preſs'd on all ſides, the Army of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> no longer able to ſuſtain the ſhock of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was put to flight; ſome of them eſcap'd to the Town, but the greateſt part diſpers'd themſelves about the Iſland, covering themſelves among the Rocks and inacceſſible Places. <hi>Demetrius</hi> himſelf got aboard certain Veſſels which he had plac'd in a neighbouring Creek to ſerve him in ſuch an exigent, and departing by Night, retir'd to the Court of King <hi>Philip,</hi> (when every Body gave him for loſt) in whoſe Service he ended his days. A hardy Man he was, but without Judgment, which appear'd by the manner of his Death; for endeavouring, purſuant to the King's Orders, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into <hi>Meſſena,</hi> hazarding too far in that Attempt, he periſh'd, as ſhall be ſhown in its proper place. As to the Conſul, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with got poſſeſſion of <hi>Pharus,</hi> which Town he preſently demoliſhed. In ſhort, after he had reduc'd the whole Kingdom of <hi>Illyria</hi> to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61906:183"/>Obedience, and perform'd all things in that Expedition to his own Mind, he return'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the Summer to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he obtain'd a magnificent Triumph, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the Reputation of a wiſe and gallant Leader.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> now receiving News of the loſs of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> deliberated no longer about entering into the War, as ſome Authors have ſaid, who pretend to have recorded the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of both Parties, and have moſt abſurdly reaſon'd thereupon; for what likelihood was there that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould now be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd about the War, when but the Year before they had ſtipulated to declare Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity whenſoever the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any Violence againſt the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> whoſe City they had now deſtroy'd? And can there be any thing more like Untruth than to tell us, That the Senate was in great Conſternation; adding, that twelve Youths, not exceeding the Age of twelve Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing introduc'd into the Senate by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and being privy to what had been there reſolv'd, diſcover'd not the leaſt tittle of what was decreed to be kept ſecret? This too certainly hath a great appearance of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, unleſs it can be made appear, that over and above their many other Advantages, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had endu'd the Childhood of the <hi>Romans</hi> with the Sagacity of Counſellors.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61906:183"/>
                     <p>But we have remark'd enough of theſe ſort of Writings; namely, ſuch as have been publiſh'd by <hi>Chaereas</hi> and <hi>Soſilus,</hi> who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgment I am able to make, have deliver'd nothing that merits the name of Hiſtory; but ought to be held as Fables and Tales, ſuch as are vulgarly told to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the People. The <hi>Romans</hi> then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intelligence of what had been done at <hi>Saguntum,</hi> in violation of the Treaty, made choice of Ambaſſadors for that Service, and diſpatch'd them to <hi>Carthage,</hi> with Inſtructions to propoſe two Conditions; whereof the one menac'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> with loſs and diſhonour, the other with a dangerous and doubtful War: For they demanded, either that <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his Abettors ſhould be deliver'd up to the diſcretion of the <hi>Romans;</hi> or in caſe of refuſal, a War to be forthwith declar'd. When the Ambaſſadors were come to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and had audience of the Senate, they deliver'd their Meſſage, which was but coldly receiv'd by the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, one of their Senators who was beſt qualify'd, was commanded to ſet forth the equity and unblameableneſs of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; but he therein mentions nothing of the Treaty of <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> no more than if ſuch a Treaty had never been; at leaſt he told them, That if ſuch an Agreement had been made, it was of no validity, as being tranſacted without the privity or conſent of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61906:184"/>the People and Senate of <hi>Carthage.</hi> And an Example was produc'd of the like practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> touching the Peace made by the Conſul <hi>Lutatius</hi> during the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War; which, in a word, <hi>Lutatius</hi> had ratify'd, when notwithſtanding it was rejected by the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> as not having been done by their allowance. They inſiſted warmly on the Conditions of that Treaty of Peace, and referr'd particularly to that which was made at the end of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War; wherein they maintain'd, That no mention was made of <hi>Spain,</hi> but reſervation only of the Allies of either Party, which were the preciſe Conditions of that Treaty. They further proceeded to ſhow, that <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> was not at that time in alliance with the <hi>Romans;</hi> which the better to prove, they caus'd the Articles of that Treaty to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly read. As to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That the Argument was not a diſpute about Words, and that regard was to be had only to the truth of Fact; namely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Saguntum</hi> had been attack'd and taken, or no? For if Matters had remain'd in the poſture wherein they were, Words might ſuffice to finiſh the Diſpute; but that City being now taken, whereby the Treaty was become violated, they were oblig'd either to deliver up the Authors of that Infraction, which would witneſs to the World, That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were guiltleſs of the Fault
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61906:184"/>that had been committed, and that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had of his own head, without their privity, acte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that violence; or in caſe they refus'd, and, on the contrary, were diſpos'd to own themſelves Acceſſaries with <hi>Hannibal;</hi> that they then would do well in one word to explain themſelves, and put an iſſue to the Diſpute. Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> ended their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſpeaking nothing but in general Terms. And here I cannot well omit what I am about to ſay, to the end thoſe whom it imports to be rightly inſtructed in Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, may not be kept in ignorance of the Truth in deliberations of Moment; and that the Lovers of Hiſtory, miſled by the Errors or Paſſions of Hiſtorians, may not loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through want of light into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which have been made between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> ſince the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Treaty that was made between them, was concluded during the Conſulſhip of <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Horatius,</hi> who were the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls after the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Kings, at the time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which was eight and twenty Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Voyage of <hi>Xerxes</hi> into <hi>Greece.</hi> We ſhall here record the very Words of the ſaid Treaty, which we have interpreted with all the Fidelity we are able; for in truth the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Language is ſo different from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61906:185"/>what is now ſpoken, that thoſe who are moſt converſant therein, find difficulty enough to explain certain hard Places, after the expence of much Time and Study. The ſaid firſt Treaty is conceiv'd in the following Terms:</p>
                     <q>There ſhall be Peace and Friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Allies of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and between the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and the Allies of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conditions; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Allies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhall not navigate beyond the <hi>Fair Promontory,</hi> unleſs conſtrain'd by Tempest, or an Enemy. If at any time they ſhall chance to be forc'd a-ſhoar, they ſhall not be permitted to buy any thing, nor take any thing but what they need for repairing their Veſſels, and for their Sacrifices. That none ſhall make longer ſtay a-ſhoar than five Days. That thoſe who ſhall come as Merchants, ſhall pay no other Duty than what is allow'd to the Common Cryer and Regiſter: That theſe two Officers ſhall make Affidavit of what ſhall be bought and ſold in their preſence, as well in <hi>Africa</hi> as <hi>Sardinia.</hi> If the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhall chance at any time to viſit ſuch Places in <hi>Sicily,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſhall attempt nothing againſt the <hi>Ardiates,</hi> the <hi>Antiates,</hi> the <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Laurentum,</hi> of <hi>Circe,</hi> and of

That they ſhall not build either Fort or Citadel in the Country of the <hi>Latins;</hi> and in caſe they ſhould at any time invade their Lands in hoſtile manner, they ſhall not remain a Night among them.</q>
                     <p>The Promontory, here call'd the <hi>Fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory,</hi> is near <hi>Carthage,</hi> tending toward the North; the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> not permitting the <hi>Romans</hi> to navigate to the Southwards of that, unwilling, I believe, that they ſhould obtain any knowledge of the Places and Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Byzaces,</hi> or the <hi>Leſſer Syrtis,</hi> where that Territory is call'd the <hi>Empories,</hi> by reaſon of the great Fertility of theſe Parts; that if any one, compell'd by Tempeſt, or the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſhould chance to touch there, and ſhould want Neceſſaries for the reſitting of their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or for their Sacrifices, theſe were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, but nothing was to be taken by force; and that thoſe who ſhould ſo land, ſhould be oblig'd to depart in five Days. But the <hi>Romans</hi> were permitted to have Trade and Commerce with <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Africk</hi> on this ſide the ſaid Promontory, as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61906:186"/>likewiſe in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and in thoſe Places in <hi>Sicily,</hi> that were under the Dominion of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> In which Intercourſe, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> promiſe to do Juſtice to all, and not to violate the Rights of any. Nay, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this Treaty, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſpake of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and of <hi>Africa,</hi> as of their own Dominions; but they ſpeak differently of <hi>Sicily,</hi> diſtinguiſhing plainly between what was, and what was not in ſubjection to them in that Iſland: In like manner the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the ſame Treaty, ſpeak of the Country of the <hi>Latins,</hi> not making mention of the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> as not being then under their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, theſe two People came after to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Treaty, wherein the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> compriz'd the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſeem by this Treaty to make it yet more evident, that they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> as their own, and ſo it was no injury to the <hi>Romans</hi> to be by them forbidden any intercourſe there. On the other hand, when they make mention of <hi>Sicily,</hi> they uſe another Stile, ſpeaking of the Places only in that Iſland that paid Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining themſelves after the ſame manner, when they ſpeak of the Territory of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> ſtipulating that no Injury ſhall be done to the <hi>Ardiates, Antiates,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Circe</hi> and <hi>Tarracina,</hi> which are Maritime Towns on the Coaſt of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that Treaty.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Treaty, that was enter'd into by theſe two People, was made about the time that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> before the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> enter'd into the War, which they wag'd for the Dominion of <hi>Sicily.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were tranſcrib'd from thoſe that went before, ſaving that they added theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: <hi>That if the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>or the</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians, <hi>ſhall chance to enter into Alliance with</hi> Pyrrhus, <hi>they ſhall however mutually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist each other in caſe of eithers being invaded
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61906:187"/>by the Enemy; and whichſoever of them ſhall ſtand in need of Succours, the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>ſhall furniſh Veſſels of Tranſport for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as likewiſe for the War: That each Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall pay their own Troops reſpectively: That the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>ſhall lend Aid to the</hi> Romans <hi>by Sea, if they ſhall need it; but that neither Party ſhall at any time compel the other to put to Sea with their Veſſels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the Oath of Ratification was made after this manner: The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> firſt ſwore by the Gods of their Country; and the <hi>Romans,</hi> after their own ancient Cuſtom, ſwore by a Stone, and then by <hi>Mars.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how they ſwore by the Stone: The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld who took the Oath, after having ſworn in behalf of the Publick, takes up a Stone, and then pronounces theſe words: <hi>If I keep my Faith, may the Gods vouchſafe their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and give me ſucceſs: If on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary I violate it, then may the other Party be entirely ſafe, and preſerv'd in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in their Laws, in their Poſſeſſions; and in a word, in all their Rights and Liberties; and may I periſh and fall alone, as now this Stone does.</hi> And then he lets the Stone fall out of his Hand.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch Treaties were then uſual, and that the <hi>Aediles</hi> had them in their keeping in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus,</hi> engrav'd in Plates of Copper, is it not ſtrange that not only <hi>Philinus</hi> the Hiſtorian ſhould be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61906:188"/>of this Cuſtom, but that many of the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſteem'd well vers'd in Publick Affairs) ſhould be likewiſe totally to ſeek therein? But for him with confidence to affirm, that it was agreed in that Treaty between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould entirely abandon <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Italy,</hi> and that this Treaty was violated by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they paſs'd over into <hi>Sicily,</hi> tho' it be moſt certain that ſuch a Stipulation never was, and that there be not the leaſt ſhadow of ground to believe there ever was any ſuch Treaty; yet our Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fairly records it, as may be ſeen in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, whereof having already ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the beginning of this our Work, we forbore then to enlarge thereon, and now obſerve that many having been miſled by this Author, have been paid with Falſhoods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Truth. And certainly whoſoever condemns the Voyage of the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> let it be cover'd with never ſo fair Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, their making Alliance with the <hi>Mamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> and ſhortly after yielding them the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours they demanded, notwithſtanding they had criminally ſurpriz'd <hi>Rhegium</hi> and <hi>Meſſina,</hi> they may perhaps herein have reaſon to blame their proceeding. But when they believe the <hi>Romans</hi> paſs'd into <hi>Sicily,</hi> contrary to their Oath, and in violation of the Treaty, they are manifeſtly deceiv'd.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61906:188"/>
                     <p>Another Treaty was made at the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the War in <hi>Sicily,</hi> the principal Conditions whereof being as followeth: That <hi>the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>ſhall retire out of</hi> Sicily, <hi>and out of all the Iſlands betwixt that and</hi> Italy: <hi>That the Allies of neither Party ſhall be injur'd or moleſted by either of them: That the one ſhall have no Authority in the others Dominions, where they ſhall neither build any Fortreſs, nor levy Soldiers for the War: That neither ſhall enter into Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with thoſe with whom the other is in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance? That the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>ſhall pay, within the ſpace of ten Tears, the ſum of two thouſand two hundred Talents, whereof one thouſand in hand, and ſhall enlarge all the</hi> Roman <hi>Priſoners Ranſon-free.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the <hi>Romans</hi> decreeing War againſt them, after their misfortunes with their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries in <hi>Africk,</hi> theſe Articles were added to the above Treaty: <hi>That the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>ſhall abandon the Iſland of</hi> Sardinia, <hi>and ſhall further pay the ſumm of one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents, as we have already noted.</hi> All theſe Treaties preceded that which was made with <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which was the very laſt wherein it was ſtipulated, <hi>That the</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians <hi>ſhould not paſs their Arms beyond the River</hi> Eber. Theſe are the ſum of all the Treaties that were made between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> from the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War to that of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61906:189"/>
                     <p>And now ſince no Proof appears, that the <hi>Romans</hi> violated their Faith by their Voyage into <hi>Sicily;</hi> ſo in their Acquiſition of <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> according to the Articles of Peace, no Pretext or ſhadow of any Cauſe can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd of the Second <hi>Punick</hi> War. While no Body queſtions but the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and parted with thoſe vaſt ſums of Money, being unrighteouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd thereunto during the Calamity of their Affairs. In ſhort, the <hi>Romans</hi> do but trifle when they tell us for a Reaſon, that many of their Poople who held Commerce in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> had been ill treated by the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> that difference having been amicably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſetting all thoſe at liberty, who had been detain'd in their Ports; in acknowledgment whereof the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> alſo quitted all their <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners without Ranſom, as hath been obſerv'd in our Firſt Book. Matters then ſtanding thus, it will behove us to inquire, which of theſe two People gave occaſion for the War of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have already recited the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Reaſons, and ſhall now obſerve what the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> have to ſay for themſelves. True it is, that albeit the <hi>Romans</hi> were highly provok'd at the deſtruction of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> nevertheleſs they did not then ſhow their Reſentments. Afterwards indeed, they and many others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides would often ſay, That they ought not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61906:189"/>to underſtand the TTreaty of <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> to be void, as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> are bold to ſay; for this Clauſe was added in that made by <hi>Lutatius: That it ſhould be firm and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if the People of</hi> Rome <hi>ratify'd it.</hi> But <hi>Aſdrubal</hi>'s Peace was confirm'd by an ample and plenary Authority, wherein it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>That the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>ſhould not make War on the other ſide the</hi> Eber. Now as to the Treaty that was made touching <hi>Sicily,</hi> that was conceiv'd as they themſelves confeſs in theſe terms, —<hi>That the Allies of the one and the other Party ſhould not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd or moleſted by either.</hi>— Not only thoſe who were at that time in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, for theſe terms were added,—<hi>That it ſhall not be permitted to make new Alliances, or to exclude from the Treaty, thoſe who were receiv'd into their Alliance, after that Peace was concluded.</hi> But foraſmuch as neither the one, nor the other Article was added to the Treaty, 'tis but juſt to believe, that all the Confederates of one and the other People, thoſe who were at that time Ally'd, and thoſe who were afterwards receiv'd into the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy were comprehended therein, and that neither the one nor the other Party ought to moleſt them. For, in ſhort, who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into terms of ſuch reſtraint whereby they became bound up from making choice of ſuch for Friends and Allies, whoſe Friendſhip
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61906:190"/>and Alliance ſhould be found profitable, or by which they ſhould be oblig'd to relinquiſh their new Confederates upon any Outrage acted on them by the other Party? My Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therefore is, that the intention both of the one and other People in that Treaty is to be underſtood, that the one ſhould not injure the Allies of the other; and that by no means the one Party was permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Alliance with the Confederates of the other; and in a word, that which follows ought to be interpreted of any new Alliances that ſhould be made in times ſucceeding — <hi>That the one Party ſhall not levy Men for the War, nor exerciſe any Authority in any of the Provinces of the others Dominions, or thoſe of their Allies, who ſhall not be diſturb'd by the one or the other Party.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being ſo, it is likewiſe manifeſt, that the <hi>Saguntines</hi> were in Alliance with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> long before <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s time, whereof the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> afford us good teſtimony: For upon a Sedition which happen'd in the City of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> they refus'd to make the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Judges and Umpires of their Differences, albeit they were their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; for they had at that time eſtabliſh'd their Authority in <hi>Spain,</hi> but made choice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whoſe Arbitration their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders were compos'd. And now if it be alledg'd, That the Deſtruction of <hi>Saguntum</hi> was the cauſe of that War, we muſt then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61906:190"/>determine, That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> began a very unjuſt War, whether regard be had either to the Treaty of <hi>Lutatius,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both Parties became mutually bound to offer no violence to their reſpective Allies; or whether in regard to that of <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> wherein it was not permitted to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> to paſs the River <hi>Eber.</hi> But then, on the other hand, if the cauſe of the War ſhall be attributed to the buſineſs of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which was violently wreſted by the <hi>Romans</hi> from the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> together with the Money which was forcibly drawn from them, it will then be but juſtice to confeſs, That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did not unrighteouſly in entering on the War made by <hi>Hannibal:</hi> For as the <hi>Romans</hi> improv'd the occaſion of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Diſtreſſes whereby to moleſt them, they did no more than lay hold on the like Opportunity againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> when it ſerv'd their purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>It is not unlikely but that thoſe who read not Hiſtory with due Judgment, will be apt to tell me, That it ſeems a ſuperfluous Work, to tarry thus long on the Subject we have been treating: If therefore ſuch a one there be, whoſe Abilities can arm him againſt all Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and who by the light of his own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can penetrate every thing; to ſuch I grant indeed, That the recounting of paſt Adventures may entertain him, tho' it miniſters little or nothing to his Inſtruction.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61906:191"/>But while we may ſafely doubt whether there be any ſuch Man, as can with aſſurance ſo determine in his own private Affairs, or in what regards the Publick; inaſmuch as let the preſent ſtate of his Fortune be never ſo proſperous, if he be a Man of ſound Sence, he will not over-boldly pronounce touching the future. I will therefore take upon me to ſay, That a right knowledge of Things paſt, is not only delightful, but neceſſary: For whether we are invaded either in our private Capacity, or in our Country, How ſhall we be able to have recourſe for ſuccour, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and obtain Friends at need, if we have never contemplated any thing but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Or how ſhall we be enabled to add to what we have already conceiv'd, or propoſe to enter into War? How ſhall we be qualify'd to engage others to take part with us, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our Enterprizes? And how, in a word, while we amuſe our ſelves with preſent things, ſhall we be qualify'd to engage our own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to acquieſce roadily to ſuch new Forms and Eſtabliſhments in the State, as we ſhall ſuggeſt, while we remain ignorant of paſt Times, whence we are to derive our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? For Mankind, for the moſt part, is govern'd by the neareſt Objects; and we are apteſt to be led to imitate preſent Examples, not reflecting how hard it is to judge of Men's Minds by their preſent Words and Comportments, modern Truth being for the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61906:191"/>moſt part diſguis'd and wrapp'd in Clouds, while the Actions of our Anceſtors declare manifeſtly, and conduct us to the knowledge of their Thoughts and Purpoſes, and tells and informs us from whom we ought to expect good Offices and Succours in our Diſtreſſes, and of whom we ought to ſuſpect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; who are likelieſt to be touch'd with our Misfortunes, who will be likelieſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Injuries we may receive, and engage to do us right. Theſe are Points, without Controverſie, of mighty importance in the Conduct of our Life, whether with regard to our private Fortune, or the Adminiſtration of the Publick. Therefore it is, that neither thoſe who write Hiſtory, nor thoſe who read it, ſhould ſo much reſt on the account of the Actions themſelves, as the things that prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or that occurr'd at the ſame time, or ſucceeded them. For if Hiſtory be defective in the Cauſes and Original of the Things we contemplate, the means by which they were brought to paſs, and the end for which they were executed; and that if it be not made evident to our Underſtanding, how and in what proportion Events hold and bear with the Actions that have been perform'd, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this will be found it may be a delightful Entertainment; but no Profit or Inſtruction can reſult from it for our future guidance.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61906:192"/>
                     <p>And if perchance any one ſhould be of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That this our Work will find but few Readers, or ſuch as will give it entertainment, by reaſon of the number and bulk of the Books it contains; yet this would happen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe, who want diſcernment in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between purchaſing and ſtudying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Books digeſted in order, and which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inſtruct the Reader by one continu'd Thread of Diſcourſe in the Tranſactions of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> from the time when <hi>Timae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> puts an end to his Hiſtory of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> down to the taking of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and of all Occurrences in other Quarters of the World, from the flight of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> to the time wherein the Battel was fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Achaians,</hi> on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> I ſay, they do not rightly conſider the difference betwixt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a General Hiſtory, and the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the ſeveral Books of other Authors, who have treated the ſame things diſtinctly and apart; for over and above that theſe Writings exceed what we have deliver'd both in number and meaſure, the fruit they yield for our Inſtruction will be leſs: For firſt, thoſe Authors, do not always agree in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the ſame matters of Fact; and then they touch not on any contemporary Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: And, after all, when you come to conferr them together, you ſhall be oblig'd to make another Judgment of what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61906:192"/>ſo compar'd, than when you ſtudy and conſider them ſingly and diſtinctly one from the other. Furthermore, that ſort of Hiſtory never arrives at the principal point of Utility; namely, to ſhow (as we but now obſerv'd) what was the iſſue of ſuch and ſuch Actions, what was contemporary and principally the Cauſes of Events, which is that which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the Body of Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>For to exemplify in our Hiſtory, it will appear how the War of <hi>Philip</hi> gave occaſion to that of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to the War of <hi>Philip;</hi> and the War of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to the <hi>Hanniballick,</hi> or ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War. In a word, by the ſtudy of General Hiſtory, we eaſily arrive at the knowledge of many important Things that come to paſs during ſuch Wars, which contribute to the War them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and which by no means is attainable by the ſtudy of particular Hiſtory; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> War againſt <hi>Perſeus</hi> or <hi>Philip;</hi> unleſs we can imagine it poſſible to be entirely inſtructed in the Art. of War, upon reading only in Hiſtory the deſcription of Battels. But ſince this cannot be, I may preſume to ſay, That this our Undertaking may be juſtly reckon'd as much ſuperiour to Relations of ſingle or particular Occurrences, as certain Knowledge is more noble than meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcourſe by hear-ſay.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61906:193"/>
                     <p>But to proceed: The <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſadors having heard the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Reaſons, made no other Anſwer than this: The graveſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, pointing to his Boſom, told thoſe of the Senate who were preſent, That they had brought with them both Peace and War; and, That it was left to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to take which they pleas'd. To which the principal Senators reply'd, That they were willing to give the <hi>Romans</hi> the preference in the Choice. Whereupon the Ambaſſadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That they then made War their Choice: Which the majority of the Senate accepted with Acclamations; whereupon they were diſmiſs'd.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who held his Winter-Quarters at <hi>New-Carthage,</hi> gave leave to his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers to retire to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Habitations, the better to diſpoſe them to his ſervice, when he ſhould have occaſion to call upon them. In ſhort, he furniſh'd <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi> his Brother with Inſtructions how to comport himſelf in his Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> in his abſence; and in what manner he was to defend himſelf againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> in caſe they ſhould chance to ſeparate. After this, his next chief care was to provide for the ſafety of <hi>Africk;</hi> and by a ſingular foreſight and ſagacity of Judgment, he ſupply'd <hi>Spain</hi> with Soldiers from <hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> with the like from <hi>Spain,</hi> the better to engage and tie thoſe two People, as it were, by mutual
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61906:193"/>Bonds, together. Thoſe that were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>Africk,</hi> were the <hi>Therſites,</hi> the <hi>Maſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Olcades,</hi> and ſome <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> of the Mountains, compoſing altogether an Army of twelve hundred Horſe, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Foot. There were likewiſe Soldiers from the <hi>Baleares,</hi> who were a ſort of Slingers; to whom, together with their Iſland, the <hi>Greeks</hi> gave that Name from the kind of Sling they us'd. It was found expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to place the greateſt part of theſe Troops in <hi>Metagonia,</hi> a Country and Promontory of <hi>Africk;</hi> and ſome were receiv'd into the City of <hi>Carthage</hi> it ſelf. They likewiſe drew out of the <hi>Metagonian</hi> Territory three thouſand Foot, who were ſent to keep Garriſon in <hi>New-Carthage,</hi> and to remain likewiſe as Hoſtages, But with <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> he left fifty Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que-reme Gallies, two Quadriremes, and five of Three Banks; of which number there were two and thirty of the Quinque-remes, and two Triremes that were equipp'd for War. He likewiſe left him four hundred and fifty <hi>African</hi> Horſe, and of <hi>Liby-Phoenicians,</hi> a People mix'd of <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> three hundred <hi>Lorgites;</hi> eighteen hundred <hi>Numidians; Maſſyles, Maſſaeſyles, Macians</hi> and <hi>Mauritanians</hi> who inhabit the Sea-Coaſt, eleven thouſand eight hundred Foot; three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Ligurians,</hi> five hundred <hi>Balearians,</hi> and one and twenty Elephants. And here let it not ſeem a Wonder, that we have undertaken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61906:194"/>to treat of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s proceeding at that time in <hi>Spain;</hi> thus minutely deſcending to ſo many particulars, that even thoſe who had a ſhare in the Conduct of thoſe Affairs could not be thought to obſerve things more narrowly: Nor let me be condemn'd, if herein I imitate thoſe, who to gain Belief and Credit with their Readers mingle their Falſhoods with the like Particularities: For it being my lot at <hi>Lacinium</hi> to peruſe there the engrav'd Tables, or Records of Copper, left by <hi>Hannibal</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abode in <hi>Italy,</hi> I made no difficulty to copy the Contents, ſince there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt the verity thereof.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hannibal</hi> had well provided for the ſafety of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> he then turn'd his Mind wholly to the buſineſs of ſome new Enterprizes, while he attended the return of his Ambaſſadors, who had been diſpatch'd to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> for he well knew that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at the foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and about the River <hi>Po</hi> was very fertile, and abounding in brave People given to War; and what was yet more to his wiſh, implacable haters of the <hi>Romans</hi> ever ſince the War they made on them. But of this we have expreſly treated in our preceding Book, to the end to help the Reader to a clearer conception of what was to follow. <hi>Hannibal</hi> then us'd his utmoſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and imploy'd all his Forces to advance his purpoſe; he promis'd every thing libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; he ſent frequent Diſpatches to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61906:194"/>Princes of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> inhabiting on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and in the Mountains them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; conceiving it wou'd be a main ſtep towards a happy iſſue of the War againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> to compaſs his paſſage through thoſe Countries we have nam'd; and that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſurmounted the many difficulties of a long march, to be able to ingage the <hi>Gauls</hi> to take part with him and joyn in the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, as he had labour'd to bring to paſs. In ſhort, after he had receiv'd an account by his Meſſengers, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> accorded to his Propoſal, and expected him with impatience; and after they had inform'd him, that tho' the Paſſage of thoſe Mountains was difficult, yet that it was not inſuperable; he began to move his Army out of their Winter Quarters early in the Spring. And having receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of what had been determin'd at <hi>Carthage,</hi> his Hopes were greatly augmented, and beholding now his Purpoſes fortify'd by the concurrence of his Fellow-Citizens, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan openly to diſcourſe of making War upon the <hi>Romans;</hi> and to exhort the Soldiers chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ingage therein, he told them, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had the Impudence publickly to demand, that both he and his Chief Officers ſhould be deliver'd up to them; he laid before them likewiſe the Fertility of the Country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he would lead them, the Good-will of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the Confederacy he had made with them; and when the Army had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61906:195"/>loudly proclaim'd their readineſs to march whitherſoever he was diſpos'd to command them, and he had gratefully applauded their chearful Behaviour, and had prefix'd the Day for their march, he diſmiſs'd the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                     <p>After he had duly provided for the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and had ſpent the Winter in all neceſſary Deliberations, upon the Day he had appointed, the Army took the Field, conſiſting of fourſcore and ten thouſand Foot, and twelve thouſand Horſe. After he had paſs'd the River <hi>Eber</hi> he reduc'd the <hi>Illyrgeti</hi> and <hi>Barguſians,</hi> the <hi>Aerenoſians,</hi> and the <hi>Andoſins</hi> or <hi>Auſetans,</hi> People that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit and ſpread as far as to the <hi>Pyraeneans.</hi> He took likewiſe ſundry Towns by force, which he effected in a ſhort time, and even beyond his hopes; but theſe Succeſſes coſt him ſome hard Conflicts, wherein he loſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men. In ſhort, he eſtabliſh'd <hi>Hanno</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Country on this ſide the <hi>Eber,</hi> and order'd that he ſhould have likewiſe the Government of the <hi>Barguſians,</hi> of which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he had the greateſt Jealouſie, as having been in Amity with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ten thouſand Foot and one thouſand Horſe to be drawn out of the Army, to be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command; committing likewiſe to his keeping the weighty Baggage of the whole Army that march'd with him; the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he ſent to their own Home, that by that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61906:195"/>means he might confirm the Affections of thoſe to whom he gave that Licence, and afford hopes to the others, who adventured with him to return one day to their Native Country; and that thoſe, who were already in Arms, as ſuch of the Natives who remain'd hitherto at eaſe in their Houſes, might yield readier obedience to his Summons into <hi>Italy,</hi> if there ſhould happen any occaſion to call upon them to recruit his Forces. So the Army march'd light, and diſincumber'd of Baggage to the number of Fifty thouſand Foot, and Nine thouſand Horſe, which he lead over the <hi>Pyrenaeans,</hi> in order to their paſſing the <hi>Rhoſne.</hi> This was no very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army, but they were good Men, and had been long train'd, and in continual Action during the Wars in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as our Hiſtory will be in danger of obſcurity, ſhould we omit the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary deſcription of Places; it ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behoveful that we here deſcribe, from the place of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s departure, the vaſt extent of ground he travers'd, and what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Nations he viſited in his march into <hi>Italy.</hi> For I hold it not enough barely to ſet down the names of Rivers and Cities, as is the method of ſome Writers, who imagine there is nothing more requir'd; and that the knowledge of things is attain'd meerly by their Names: While, for my own part, I conceive it ſit to obſerve, that as 'tis true,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61906:196"/>that with reſpect to places and things we already know, the naming only may ſuffice to renew the Notices of them in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yet where we are totally in the dark, I reckon it equally as uſeleſs to inſiſt barely on the Names, as to rehearſe a certain number of Words that have no ſignification: For while the Mind is deſtitute of the means to conceive rightly of what is the Subject of our Contemplation, and is not inabled to apply what we hear to ſomething that we know, we gather no more Fruit from ſuch a Diſcourſe, than if it were ſpoken to a deaf Ear. It will import us then to propoſe ſome certain method whereby we may be able to give right and eaſie Images of things, when we deliver Matter whereof the Underſtanding hath not yet taken the leaſt Impreſſion. The firſt and moſt general receiv'd Notion, and that which (as one may ſay) is common to Mankind, is the repartition that we have made of the Heavens, whereby we aſſign the ſeat and poſition of the reſpective Climates and Regions: For who, the moſt ſtupid, doth not know, <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt, North</hi> and <hi>South?</hi> The next Notion is, that by aſſigning to thoſe repartitions in the Heavens certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of ſuch a poſition here on Earth, as are ſubjected to thoſe above, whereby we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a ſort of Science of thoſe Places and Countries, which we have never ſeen, and otherwiſe know nothing of. This Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61906:196"/>is only touching the Earth in general: What is next to be done, is to inſtruct the Reader to make the ſame diviſion (as far as we know) of the Earth, which is underſtood to be diſtributed into the principal Parts; as namely, <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> then, that theſe three are bounded by the <hi>Tanais,</hi> the <hi>Nile,</hi> and the Streight of <hi>Hercules. Aſia</hi> extends from the River <hi>Nile,</hi> Eaſtward and Southward. <hi>Africk</hi> ſtretcheth from the <hi>Nile</hi> towards <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, then extends South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and South-weſtward to the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial. In ſhort, theſe two Parts, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the whole Globe, contain that entire proportion of Continent to the Southward of <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, ſtretching from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Europe,</hi> its ſituation is Northward, in oppoſite poſition to the other two, and is continu'd, as it were, in a Line from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt.</hi> The principal and greateſt part thereof hath Northerly Situation, lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> and that of <hi>Narbona,</hi> which, on the Weſtern part is not far from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and the Mouth of the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> near which that River empties it ſelf into the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinian</hi> Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Celtae</hi> inhabit all the Country in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Narbona,</hi> and ſpread from thence to the <hi>Pyrenaeans,</hi> which are a Chain of Mountains, continu'd from our Sea quite to the great Ocean: The other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61906:197"/>running from thoſe Hills to the utmoſt <hi>Weſt,</hi> and to the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> are in a great meaſure bounded by our Sea, and that of the Ocean; that Portion thereof which borders on our Sea, to <hi>Hercules</hi>-Pillars, is called <hi>Iberia;</hi> but that which is waſh'd by the main Ocean remains yet without a Name; it being not long ſince any diſcovery has been made thereof, and found to be inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many barbarous Nations, whereof we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak in particular, in the purſuit of our Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, as it is not yet known whether <hi>Aethiopia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> are join'd, and in one continu'd Continent, extending to the <hi>South,</hi> or be inviron'd by the Sea; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all that Tract of Land, contain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Narbona,</hi> towards the <hi>North,</hi> is to us at this day totally unknown. And thoſe who ſpeak or write otherwiſe, are to be held only as Reporters of Fables, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us with the Effects of their own Dreams and Viſions.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I have thought needful to ſay, the better to qualifie thoſe who are not over converſant in Geography, to ſtudy our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with greater Profit; and to the end they may arrive with more Facility at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what they are yet to know, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them with things whereof they are already inform'd; and as to what relates, at leaſt, to the general diſtribution of the Parts,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61906:197"/>they may be taught to apprehend rightly of the Regions below from the poſition of the Climates above. For as it is ordinary with us to turn our Eyes towards the Object that is pointed to us to obſerve; ſo in proportion to the evidence, whereby things are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Underſtanding, by Words or Diſcourſe, the Mind conceives and becomes enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.</p>
                     <p>But to return from our digreſſion: The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were, in thoſe times, Maſters of all that tract of Country in <hi>Africk,</hi> that runs along the Coaſt of our Sea, from the <hi>Philaenian</hi> Altars, which are by the great <hi>Syrtis,</hi> to the Streight of <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars; which Dominion contains above ſix hundred Leagues in length. They had now likewiſe carry'd their Conqueſts into <hi>Spain,</hi> being on the other ſide the Streight, which divides the two Continents, having ſubdu'd that Country intirely, as far as the Promontory or Rock in our Sea, which terminates the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Hills, that are the boundaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spaniards:</hi> This Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition extending at leaſt three hundred Leagues in length, from <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars to <hi>New Carthage,</hi> from whence <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſet out on his Expedition to <hi>Italy,</hi> is computed about one hundred and twenty Leagues. This Town we call, according to ſome, <hi>New Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> it being, by others, call'd <hi>Cainopolis,</hi> or the <hi>New Town.</hi> From thence, to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61906:198"/>River <hi>Eber,</hi> it is at leaſt one hundred Leagues; from the <hi>Eber</hi> to <hi>Emporium,</hi> about ſixty Leagues; and thence to the Paſſage of the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> near the ſame diſtance: but theſe diſtances the <hi>Romans</hi> have ſet down in their Miles, each Mile containing eight Stades or Furlongs.</p>
                     <p>It is computed from the Paſſage of the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> up towards the head of the River, to the beginning of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which lead into <hi>Italy,</hi> about ſeventy Leagues, without taking in the way in the Mountains, which is reckon'd fifty Leagues; from whence you deſcend into <hi>Italy,</hi> coming into a Campaigne Country, water'd by the River <hi>Po;</hi> ſo the March of <hi>Hannibal</hi> from <hi>New Carthage</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> will amount to about three hundred and forty Leagues. And now, if we take only the length of the way into our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had already perform'd half his Journey; but when the difficulties yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind come to be weigh'd, the worſt, by much, will be found yet remaining.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal</hi> therefore labour'd his utmoſt to get the <hi>Pyrenaeans</hi> at his back, being not without ſuſpicion of the fidelity of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> doubting leſt they ſhould block up his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which he found difficult enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out encountring other Impediments. In the mean time, after the <hi>Romans</hi> were inform'd by their Ambaſſadors, whom they had ſent to <hi>Carthage,</hi> of all that had paſs'd, and had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61906:198"/>been determin'd there; and receiving notice earlier than they expected, of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Eber,</hi> they decreed that <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio</hi> ſhould be diſpatch'd into <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius Sempronius</hi> into <hi>Africk.</hi> But while they were buſied about their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and the neceſſary Preparations for the War, they le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t not, however, to proſecute another deſign they had before in hand; namely, to diſpatch Colonies to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Cis-Alpine Gauls.</hi> They proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe, with great diligence to begirt their Towns with Walls, ordering thoſe who were ordain'd for the Colonies, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to about ſix thouſand, who were to People the two Towns, that were to be built, to be at the Rendezvouſe within the ſpace of thirty days. One of which Towns they plac'd on this ſide the <hi>Po,</hi> and gave it the name of <hi>Placentia;</hi> the other beyond the River, which they call'd <hi>Cremona.</hi> Theſe Colonies were hardly arriv'd; when the <hi>Boians</hi> (who endeavour'd nothing more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently than to break with the <hi>Romans;</hi> but for want of a proper conjuncture, had not yet attempted any thing) hearing of the approach of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new hopes; and abandoning their Hoſtages, which had been given to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> at the end of the War (which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in our preceding Book) revolted, and took Arms againſt them. Theſe drew like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61906:199"/>to their ſide the <hi>Inſubrians,</hi> who were eaſily lead to take part with them, out of an ancient hatred they bare to the <hi>Romans.</hi> So they march'd out, and fell to ſpoil the new planted Territories, and advancing after thoſe, who had fled to <hi>Modena</hi> for Succour, purſu'd them thither, and there beſieg'd them; where likewiſe were ſhut up the three Commiſſioners, who had been ſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the Colonies, and ſet out the Lands, Men of great account; the one <hi>Caius Luta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who had been Conſul, and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Praetors: Theſe propos'd to come to ſome Treaty, which the <hi>Boians</hi> ſeem'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; but when they adventur'd out to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about the Terms, they brake their word, and ſeiz'd their Perſons, perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that with ſuch a gauge, they ſhould be able to preſerve their Hoſtages. Upon notice of theſe Stirs, <hi>Lucius Manlius</hi> the Praetor, who then commanded an Army in thoſe Parts, march'd to their Relief with all the ſpeed he could. But the Enemy getting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his approach, laid an Ambuſh in a certain Foreſt in his way, where the <hi>Romans</hi> had no ſooner entred, when the <hi>Boians</hi> fell upon them, attacking them on all ſides, and putting the greateſt part to the Sword, the reſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>led, and having gain'd the Hills, there made a ſtand, and with difficulty enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves, but at length made a good Retreat. Tho' the <hi>Boians</hi> left not the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61906:199"/>purſuit till they had chas'd them into a Town call'd <hi>Tanetus,</hi> which ſome call <hi>Canetus,</hi> where they block'd them up. When the news came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the fourth Legion was thus beſieg'd by the <hi>Boians,</hi> they order'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Legion that had been appointed to <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to march to their Relief, giving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thereof to the Praetor <hi>Lucius Atilius,</hi> with orders to raiſe more Troops among their Allies. This is the account of what was tranſacted in <hi>Gaul,</hi> after the War broke out, to the arrival of <hi>Hannibal;</hi> the ſtate of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in that Province being ſuch as was before related, and as we but now deliver'd.</p>
                     <p>Early in the Spring the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls, having made due proviſion of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to put their Purpoſes in execution, embark'd for their reſpective Governments, <hi>Publius</hi> ſteering towards <hi>Spain</hi> with ſixty Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and <hi>Tiberius Sempronius</hi> with a Fleet of one hundred and ſixty; whoſe Mind was ſo inflam'd with deſire of Action, and exalted with the proviſion he had made at <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> that he thought on nothing more than lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſiege forthwith to <hi>Carthage</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> kept along the Coaſt of <hi>Liguria,</hi> and in ſix Days arriv'd from <hi>Piſa</hi> at <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> and coming to the hither mouth of the River <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> which they call the <hi>Marſeillian,</hi> he began to land his Troops; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had receiv'd notice of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſs'd the <hi>Pyrenaeans,</hi> he concluded how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61906:200"/>that he could not be ſo near as he was; the difficulties of the Way, and the many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> by whom the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was to make his Paſſage, made him of that Judgment. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> had ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all theſe Difficulties, having bought his paſſage of ſome, and won it by force of Arms from others, and was now got with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Paſs over the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> having the Sea of <hi>Sardinia</hi> on his right. When <hi>Publius</hi> receiv'd the news of the Enemy's approach, he did not at firſt believe it, as ſeeming to him incredible, that he ſhould be able to perform ſo difficult a march in ſo ſhort a ſpace: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, he thought it adviſable to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after ſuch intelligence as he might rely upon; accordingly, while his Army lay to refreſh themſelves, and recover from the Toils of their Voyage, conſulting with his Officers what Poſts would be moſt proper to poſſeſs, and what way to take that he might get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Enemy, he commanded out three hundred choice Horſe to diſcover; to whom, for their Guides, and farther to ſuſtain them, he appointed the <hi>Gauls</hi> to be join'd, who were in pay to thoſe of <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal</hi> being now on the Banks of the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> within four Days march of the Sea, at a certain place where the Channel of that River was not very large, determin'd ſpeedily to paſs his Army, after he had bought the Good-will of the People of the Country, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61906:200"/>purchas'd all their Canoes and Boats, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there were great numbers; foraſmuch as thoſe who live on that River Traſſick on the Sea. Furthermore he amaſs'd great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Materials proper for the making of Floats, whereof the Soldiers in the ſpace of two Days had made abundant proviſion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one labouring his utmoſt to excuſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of other Aid, being reſolv'd to owe their paſſage over the River to their own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Induſtry. In the mean time, the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, on the oppoſite ſide, aſſembled in great numbers to oppoſe their Landing; which <hi>Hannibal</hi> no ſooner perceiv'd, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it impoſſible to compaſs his Intent by force, having ſo numerous an Enemy to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him; and that he could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main where he was, without danger of being encompaſs'd by the Enemy, unleſs he ſpeedily attempted ſomething. Whereupon, after three Days debate, about the firſt Watch of the Night, he detach'd a Party of his Army (with the <hi>Gauls</hi> of the Country for their Guides) under the leading of <hi>Hanno</hi> the Son of <hi>Bomilcar.</hi> After theſe had march'd about five and twenty Miles up the River, they came to a place where the Water makes a ſmall Iſland, and there halted. In this place they fell'd great quantities of Timber in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Woods, and in a ſhort time made a ſufficient number of Floats to waſt them; and ſo got a ſafe paſſage over the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61906:201"/>to oppoſe them: And having gain'd a piece of Ground, whoſe ſituation fortify'd it ſelf, they there repos'd that Day, not only to refreſh themſelves after ſo toilſome an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, but likewiſe to prepare for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecution of what had been given them in Orders. In the mean while, <hi>Hannibal</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay'd by all means poſſible to paſs over the River with that part of the Army that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd with him; and nothing now ſo much troubled him, as how to imbark his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, which were to the number of forty eight.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Night, after the Detachment had paſs'd the River, they drew near the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were aſſembled to oppoſe <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Landing; who, at the ſame time having his Troops in readineſs, order'd his Horſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark in the great Veſſels, and the beſt of his Foot in ſmall Boat, prepar'd to paſs over. But to the end his Floats and ſmall Boats might go with more ſecurity, he order'd the greater Veſſels to keep above the Stream, thereby to check the Current of the River. Another invention they had likewiſe to tranſport their Horſes; they did not imbark them, but ſwam in a Tow after their ſmall Boats, one Man holding three or four by the Bridle on each ſide the Boat: Thus many were carry'd over at the firſt eſſay.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61906:201"/>
                     <p>The Barbarians beholding all this Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ran in haſte and diſorder out of their Camp, conceiving they ſhould have no great difficulty to repulſe the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> But as ſoon as <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiv'd the Party on the other ſide to approach, (for according to the Orders <hi>Hanno</hi> had receiv'd, they made the ſigns of their drawing near by Smoak in ſeveral places as they march'd) he order'd his People to move, the great Veſſels to keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, with Directions to thoſe that govern'd them to ſtem the Current, keeping the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with their bow upon the Stream, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cover the others from danger. So each one animating his Companion with auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Words, Labour'd with incredible Induſtry to ſtem the violence of the Current. In the mean time, the Enemy, on the other ſide, gave them to underſtand by their Cries, not unlike to Howlings, that they expected them with reſolution, inſomuch that the proſpect every where was terrible, and held the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators in great perplexity.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having thus at once gain'd the Victory and their Paſſage, us'd all poſſible diſpatch in the tranſporting what was yet remaining on the other ſide the River; and when that Work was over, they encamp'd that Night on the Bank. The next Morning, having receiv'd Intelligence that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, with their Fleet, was arriv'd at the mouth of the <hi>Rhoſne, Hannibal</hi> detach'd five hundred <hi>Numidian</hi> Horſe, with order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and bring an account of the Enemy.

                     <p>In ſhort, after <hi>Magilus</hi> had aſſur'd them he would be their Conductor through all thoſe Paſſages by which they were to march, and that they ſhould ſhortly arrive in ſafety in <hi>Italy,</hi> and want for nothing in their Journey, they thought it reaſonable to yield entire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to what he ſaid; they were likewiſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encourag'd by what they heard of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and fertility of the Country they were to invade, and with the chearful and frank Behaviour of thoſe who were to joyn with them in their Conflicts with the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Gauls</hi> being now retir'd out of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, <hi>Hannibal</hi> return'd, where he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his People, firſt, the important Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had already atchiev'd; how many notable Services by his Counſel and Leading they had already perform'd; how many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous Adventures they had gone through, whereof not any Man there had cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: Then he exhorted them to continue firm in their Reſolutions, inaſmuch as they were of themſelves convinc'd, that the moſt difficult part of the Work was now paſs'd, their Paſſage over the River ſucceeding to their own Wiſhes; nor could there be any remaining doubt of the Fidelity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of their Allies; he requir'd, in ſhort, that they would entertain no anxious Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the future; but rely firmly on his Care and Circumſpection; telling them, that by an entire reſignation to his Conduct and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61906:203"/>they would give the beſt and ſureſt Marks of their Reſolution, and aſcertain their Title to the Glory they had already won. And now, after the Soldiers, by their Words and Actions had unanimouſly ſignify'd their approbation and readineſs to obey him, and their willingneſs to engage in all Dangers. <hi>Hannibal</hi> praiſing their forwardneſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the aſſiſtance of the Gods for their Preſervation, commanded them to retire to their repoſe, and to be in a readineſs to march, for that he determin'd to decamp the next Day; ſo they departed.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſembly was no ſooner diſmiſs'd when the <hi>Numidians</hi> return'd, who had been ſent abroad to diſcover; of whom a great part were cut off, and thoſe who eſcap'd had ſav'd themſelves by ſlight. For having incountred it ſeems, not far from the Camp, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Horſe-men of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had ſent abroad on the ſame Errand, they had ingag'd ſo roughly, that on the part of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> an hundred and fifty were kill'd on the ſpot, and of the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> above two hundred, the <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing the reſt to their Camp; by which means they got knowledge of what had paſs'd with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and ſo retir'd to their own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with all the expedition they were able, to aſſure the Conſul of the Enemies arrival. Whereupon the <hi>Romans</hi> decamp'd, imbarking all their Baggage on board the Fleet, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61906:203"/>wiſhing to come to action with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they took their march up the River.</p>
                     <p>The Day after <hi>Hannibal</hi> had made his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Army, he order'd all the Horſe to move and march toward the Sea-Coaſt, to intercept any ſudden Danger that might threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from that Quarter; then he commanded the Foot to follow, while himſelf attended the coming of the Elephants, and thoſe whom he had left to conduct them. And here it will not be amiſs that we give an account how they imbark'd thoſe mighty Beaſts. They made many Floats of Timber, whereof they joyn'd two and two together; theſe Floats were fifty Foot long each, and were plac'd pointing out into the River, their inmoſt ends reſting on the Bank, and all well united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; then they faſten'd others to the ends of thoſe, reaching yet farther out into the River; theſe Machines ſo fram'd (reſembling in ſome ſort a Bridge) were well ſuſtain'd and faſten'd with Cordage on all parts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the violence of the Stream. They moor'd or faſten'd this Platform to the Trees which grew on the Bank, whereof there were good ſtore; after having inlarg'd and run out this Work to about two hundred Foot in length, they joyn'd to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of two other large ſubſtantial Floats well faſten'd together, which they ſo joyn'd to the ſix'd Platform with Ropes, as to be able eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to disjoyn them from the other; to theſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61906:204"/>moveable Floats they faſten'd Ropes whereby to tow and draw them, with Boats appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe, to the other ſide the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to hold them up againſt the Current, that it might not drive down the Stream when the Machine ſhould be looſen'd from the fix'd Stage; then they cover'd the ſurface of it with Earth, to make it appear firm Ground, like that on the Bank, for the Elephants were taught an exact Obedience to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and were ſo in all things, paſſing over the Water only excepted, whereof they ſtood in great fear: Wherefore, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on the reſt, they led two gentle Female Elephants foremoſt, the others following. They being brought to the outermoſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Floats, they then unty'd the Ropes by which they were faſten'd, and tow'd the ſaid Float with the Cargo of Elephants to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. The Beaſts were terrify'd at firſt, and ran from one ſide to the other of the Float, but beholding nothing but Water on all ſides, their ſear then kept them in order. Thus by ſeveral Voyages they wafted over all their Elephants, ſome few excepted, which leap'd through fear into the Water, when they were in the middle of the Stream; but theſe were likewiſe preſerv'd, tho' their Guides periſh'd, for by the help of their great Trunks, which they held above Water, they thereby diſcharg'd their Stomachs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they had taken in, and breath'd with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61906:204"/>freedom. By this Artifice they tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Elephants to the other ſide the River.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Hannibal</hi> poſting his Horſe and his Elephants in the Rear of the Army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd his march down the Stream towards the Eaſt. The ſource or head of the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> is ſituate far up in the Country, above the Gulf of the <hi>Adriatick</hi>-Sea towards the Weſt; in thoſe parts of the <hi>Alpes</hi> which regard the North, tending in its paſſage towards the Southweſt, and diſcharging it ſelf into the <hi>Sardinian</hi>-Sea. In ſhort, this River for the moſt part makes its paſſage through a Champaign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, environ'd on both ſides with Mountains, whoſe North-ſide is inhabited by the <hi>Gauls-Ardienſes,</hi> the other is bounded by the North-ſide of the <hi>Alpes.</hi> That part of the <hi>Alpes</hi> which runs from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> ſeparates the plain Country in the neighbourhood of the <hi>Po,</hi> whereof we have already ſpoken, from the Plain where the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> hath its paſſage. <hi>Hannibal</hi> then took his march through that Country where the River hath its ſource, to come into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Authors, who have writ of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s paſſage over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> entertain us with aſtoniſhing and incredible Tales of that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, without heeding that they have thereby committed two Errors, which Hiſtory of all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61906:205"/>things will not permit, for they are conſtrain'd thereby to coin Falſhoods of their own, and often become liable to contradict themſelves. For as they give to <hi>Hannibal</hi> all the Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of a great and valiant Leader; ſo at the ſame time they make him act with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Imprudence imaginable. Then when they are taken in their own fabulous Snares, they are forc'd to bring down the Gods and Demi-Gods to their Aid, who ſhould not be nam'd but in matters of Truth. Furthermore, they feign that the <hi>Alpes</hi> are ſo deſart and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible, that far from being paſſable by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Horſes, and Elephants, Men cannot, without unſpeakable travel, paſs them on foot. They tell us farther, that ſome parts thereof are ſo waſte and deſtitute of all Succour, that without the Aid of ſome Divinity, who led <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as it were by the Hand, through thoſe wild Labyrinths he and his Army had inevitably periſh'd; theſe, I ſay, are two Faults in an Hiſtorian, which Men of common Sence eaſily diſcover and diſlike.</p>
                     <p>For, in ſhort, were there Truth in what they deliver, where could there be found in Story a more imprudent General, or Leader worſe qualify'd than <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who being at the head of ſo numerous an Army, in the proſperity of which all his Hopes were plac'd, neither knowing any thing of the Country through which he was to march, nor the courſe he was to take, nor whither he went,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61906:205"/>nor with whom he was to have to do; and what fourth he fell into much danger. Folly, had ingag'd in an Enterprize, which, by the common Rules of Reaſon, yielded no proſpect of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but on the contrary, to all appearance, purſu'd an Attempt totally unfeiſible? For theſe Authors make <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the ſpring of his Hopes at the head of a flouriſhing victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Army, perform ſuch things as are not likely would be acted by a People already vanquiſh'd and undone, and reduc'd to the laſt extremity; namely, to ingage their Troops in Countries and Places totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. For while they tell us all was waſte and deſart, and the Country no where paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, do they not plainly accuſe their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries? But they knew not that the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who inhabit about the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> had often paſs'd the <hi>Alpes</hi> with numerous Armies, long before <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s time; and not only heretofore, but of late days, they had march'd to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe <hi>Gauls</hi> who dwell about the <hi>Po,</hi> during their Wars with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, they were to learn that even the <hi>Alpes</hi> themſelves are inhabited by numerous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but it was their Ignorance indeed that brought the Demi-God down to ſhow <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> his way. Wherein they follow the Poets, who in their Tragedies, having for the moſt part nothing but Fiction and extravagant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures for the ſubject of their Plays, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring nothing handſomely to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61906:206"/>a God or a Machine. After this manner our Hiſtorians have proceeded, being forc'd to implore ſome Divinity or other to yield them aſſiſtance, and diſintangle them from the Falſhoods and Improbabilities they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have made. For how can a fabulous beginning have other than a fabulous Iſſue? Moſt certain it is that <hi>Hannibal</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct his Affairs at the rate theſe Authors would perſuade, but like a wiſe and able Captain. And there is no doubt, but he well knew that the Country into which he was leading his Army, was fertile and abounding in all things, and the Inhabitants alien'd in their Inclinations to the <hi>Romans;</hi> that he had with him for Guides the very People of the Country, who had engag'd to partake with him in all his Fortunes. For my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I ſpeak of theſe things with ſo much the more aſſurance, by how much I have not only been inſtructed therein by thoſe who liv'd in thoſe Days; but that I might be leſs liable to Error, I made my ſelf a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Alpes</hi> for my better Information.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, <hi>Publius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General arriv'd with his Army at the Paſſage of the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> three days after <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s departure, who perceiving the Enemy gone, was much ſurpriz'd, and without doubt with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for he could ſcarce be perſwaded, that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> would ever have been drawn to attempt that way into <hi>Italy;</hi> eſpecially
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61906:206"/>having to deal with ſo many barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his March, uncapable of Friendſhip or keeping their Faith. But after he had a while reflected on the boldneſs of the undertaking, he march'd back to the Fleet; where embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Army with all expedition, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching his Brother to carry on the War in <hi>Spain,</hi> he reſolv'd himſelf to return by Sea into <hi>Italy,</hi> to make head againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>In the mean ſpace, after four days march <hi>Hannibal</hi> arrives at a place call'd the <hi>Iſle,</hi> where the Country is rich and well Peopled. It is ſo call'd, becauſe the <hi>Soane</hi> environs it on one ſide, and the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> on the other, giving it the ſigure of a Triangle. This I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, both for form and magnitude, much reſembles another in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Delta;</hi> and if there be any difference in the compariſon, it is that <hi>Delta</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with rough and almoſt inacceſſible Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Here <hi>Hannibal</hi> found two Princes, that were Brethren, in Arms againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the Dominion of the Country, their Armies being drawn up ready to ingage. The elder of theſe two made his addreſſes to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> praying his aid to re-eſtabliſh him in his Inheritance, to which he lent a willing ear, foreſeeing the Profit he might reap there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; wherefore, after he had entred into
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61906:207"/>Friendſhip with him, and compell'd the other to retire, he receiv'd many ſingular benefits of the ſaid Prince, who did not only ſupply his Army with refreſhments, and whatever they ſtood in need of; but exchanging <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s old worn-out Arms for new ones, which he deliver'd him; he did in ſome ſort recruit his Army. He further ſupply'd them with what Cloaths they wanted, and greatly aſſiſted them in their Paſſage over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. But the moſt remarkable ſervice he did them, was, that foraſmuch as they were in ſome jealouſie in paſſing the Frontiers of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> call'd <hi>Allobroges,</hi> he conducted <hi>Hannibal</hi> by another way more ſafe, and brought him to the place where they begin to aſcend the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal</hi> having march'd near an hundred Miles in ten days along the River <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> met with mighty difficulties after his Army had enter'd on the Mountains; and in truth the <hi>Allobroges</hi> had no purpoſe to attack them, while they held their March in the Plains, fearing both their Horſe, and the <hi>Gauls</hi> that accompany'd the Army. But theſe were no ſooner gone, and that <hi>Hannibal</hi> began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the Mountains, when they drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great numbers, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Poſts where <hi>Hannibal</hi> muſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly March; and moſt aſſuredly, had they but kept themſelves longer conceal'd, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Army had run a mighty hazard;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61906:207"/>but being diſcover'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> tho' they did him ſome Miſchief, they were requited with equal loſs. For <hi>Hannibal</hi> was no ſooner inform'd, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were Maſters of the Paſſes, when he made his Army halt, and take their Quarters that Night among the Rocks and Faſtneſſes. In the mean while he diſpatch'd a Party of <hi>Gauls,</hi> who ſerv'd him for Guides, to diſcover the Poſture of the Enemy, and learn what they could of their purpoſe. And having underſtood that they kept Guard in thoſe places only by Day, but that in the Night they retir'd to a Town not far off; he found this Expedient to obviate the preſent Inconvenience: He decamp'd in broad Day, and by ſlow Motions advanc'd with his Army; till arriving not far from the Streights, he then encamp'd not far from the Enemy; and cauſing Fires to be made in the Camp about the firſt Watch of the Night, where he left the greateſt part of his Troops, himſelf, in the mean while, with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his beſt Men, paſs'd the Streights in the Night; and while the Enemy was retir'd to the Town, according to their Cuſtom, took poſſeſſion of thoſe Poſts, where they were wont before to keep their Guard.</p>
                     <p>When Day diſcover'd to the Enemy what had paſs'd, they did not preſently determine what to do; but when they obſerv'd the great quantity of Baggage that appear'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the Horſe could afford them no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61906:208"/>ſuccour, which by reaſon of the narrow, ſtony, and broken ways, could not march but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files, they then reſolv'd on the Attack. And now as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> thus fell on them from all Quarters at once, the Way it ſelf being almoſt as terrible as the Enemy, the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> receiv'd great loſs, eſpecially in their Horſes and Beaſts of Carriage; for the Way being ſtreight, ſtony, and broken, the Beaſts of Burden were eaſily thrown down, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd, falling into Precipices. But the Horſes that were wounded gave them the greateſt trouble; for falling by their Wounds among the other Beaſts, and labouring to riſe and recover their Feet in ſo narrow a Way, ſo crowded, they caſt down others by their ſtriving to ſave themſelves; which was the occaſion of great Labour and Tumult. This being obſerv'd and conſider'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who well knew the Army could not ſubſiſt without their Beaſts of Burthen, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd their Neceſſaries, he immediately left the Poſts he had taken, and came to the relief of thoſe who were thus hard preſs'd in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; when falling on the Enemy from high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Ground, he did not fail of doing them great Damage: But the evil was, that his own People were thereby equal Sufferers; for the fear encreaſing every-where by this new Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, many miſcarry'd and were loſt in the Crowd; but, in the end, moſt of the <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broges</hi> were ſlain on the place, and the reſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61906:208"/>ſav'd themſelves by Flight. And now their Horſes and other Beaſts, after ſome time of reſt, were led with great trouble and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through the Streight; but <hi>Hannibal,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had eſcap'd this Danger, march'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a good Detachment againſt the Town, that had harbour'd the Enemy, which he took without reſiſtance, finding it almoſt quite deſerted, the Inhabitants being all gone out in hopes of Booty. This adventure prov'd very uſeful to his Affairs, both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the preſent and the future: For he here recover'd many, both Men and Horſes, and other Beaſts, which had fallen into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's hands, and Cattel and Corn ſufficient to ſuſtain the Army for three Days. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, the Terror he had given by this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the circumjacent places was ſuch, that none of the <hi>Gauls</hi> inhabiting the Towns near which he was to paſs, gave him the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation in his Paſſage. In this Town <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> took up his Quarters, where he remain'd a Day to reſt and refreſh his Army, and then proſecuted his Journey. For three Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether he march'd without Trouble or Alarm, but the fourth he fell into much danger. The People inhabiting in the Towns on the way he was to paſs, having ſecretly conſpir'd againſt him, met him however, with Olive-branches, and Garlands of Flowers, Signs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of Peace and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as the <hi>Caduceus</hi> is among the <hi>Greeks,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61906:209"/>Hannibal,</hi> who had now learn'd how far he was to truſt theſe People, endeavour'd by Queſtions to inform himſelf of their Purpoſes. They told him, That they had receiv'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Succeſs againſt the Town, and of the loſs and defeat of thoſe who had attack'd him in his march; but as to themſelves, they came to give him aſſurance, That they were reſolv'd to do him no Injury, nor ſuffer any to be done to him by others: And that they were ready to give him Hoſtages for their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. <hi>Hannibal</hi> remain'd long undetermin'd what to do, having no great Opinion of their Sincerity; but, in the end, weighing that to make a ſhow of believing them, might work on their Good-nature, and by degrees win them to his Friendſhip, if he ſeem'd to accept their Tenders; and that in caſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, they might preſently become his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he feign'd to conſent to their Propoſal; and ſeem'd, as they did, diſpos'd to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to terms of Friendſhip with them. In ſhort, after theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> had given him ſecurity for their peaceable Behaviour, ſupply'd his Army with Proviſions, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd among the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of freedom and confidence, <hi>Hannibal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have a better Opinion of their Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and accepted their Service for his Guides through the many remaining difficult Ways by which they were to paſs. Howbeit, after they had thus conducted the Army for two
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61906:209"/>Days together, they aſſembled at length all into one Body, and attack'd the Rear at a Defile, or ſtreight Paſſage, as they were marching in a Valley full of Rocks and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ground.</p>
                     <p>Great likelihood there was that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Army had here run the hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely deſtroy'd, had not their General, who reſerv'd a ſecret doubt of the well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this People, obviated the miſchief of this treaſonable Purpoſe of theirs, by ordering his Horſe and Baggage to march in the Van of the Army, and his choiceſt Foot to ſuſtain the Rear. But having diſpos'd matters after this manner, his loſs became leſs grievous; for his Foot in the Arrear-guard prov'd ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to put a ſtop to the violence of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Nevertheleſs, they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great loſs both of Men and Horſes; and the Enemy, who was poſſeſs'd of the Ground above them, brought ſuch terror into the Army, by rowling down mighty Stones and Rocks from the Precipices upon them, and ſhowring Vollies of Stones on their Heads, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was compell'd to take up his Quarters for that Night on the top of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, expos'd to the open Sky, with that part of the Army that was with him, remote from the Horſe and the reſt of the Troops, and the Baggage, the better to cover and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, them from danger; who were hardly able, in all that Night, with great labour, to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61906:210"/>compaſs their paſſage through the Valley. In the Morning, the Enemy being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd, <hi>Hannibal</hi> join'd his Army and Baggage, and advanc'd towards the top of the <hi>Alpes.</hi> After this the <hi>Gauls</hi> attempted no more to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them in Bodies, but in ſmaller Parties, and with leſs ardour than before; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs falling ſometimes on the Van, ſometimes on the Rear of the Army, they ſeldom fail'd of making ſome ſpoil of the Baggage. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants happen'd to be of great uſe to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in theſe Conflicts; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they chanc'd to appear, they ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the Enemy, that the Army march'd by that means with much leſs moleſtation. In nine Days after this, <hi>Hannibal</hi> gain'd the top of the Mountains, where he halted two Days, being willing to give ſome repoſe to ſuch of his Army as were come thus far without Wound or Sickneſs, and to attend the coming of the reſt of his Troops that were yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. During this ſtay, many Horſes and Beaſts of Carriage, which had fallen and ſtray'd out of the way, came in of their own accord, following the Track of the Army to the great wonder of the Beholders.</p>
                     <p>But whereas the Snows were yet great in the Mountains, (Winter not being there quite over) <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiving his Soldiers to be ſomewhat diſcourag'd by reaſon of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they had already felt, and out of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what yet threaten'd them, caus'd
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61906:210"/>the Army to be aſſembled, to the end he might ſpeak to them, and inſpire them with new Reſolution; which he could no way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect, than by giving them a view and proſpect of <hi>Italy;</hi> which, in a word, lies ſo fairly to the Eye, ſpreading and extending it ſelf at the foot of thoſe Mountains, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to have deſign'd them as a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to cover and defend it. So he gave them a ſurvey of the Champaign Country that ſpreads it ſelf all about the River <hi>Po;</hi> and gave them to underſtand how welcome they ſhould be to the People that Inhabited it. He pointed out likewiſe to them whereabout the City of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtood; and by this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice animated his haraſs'd Army. The Day following he decamp'd, and began to deſcend the Mountains; and now ſaw no more of the Enemy to moleſt them in their march, ſaving ſome ſmall ſcatter'd Parties, who rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waited occaſions how to ſteal than to fight. Howbeit, <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Loſſes were not leſſen'd, by reaſon of the great Snows and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad march they had had, which much weaken'd the Army. Nor was their paſſage much better in the deſcent; for what with the ſtreight, ſteep, and ſlippery ways, and the depth of the Snow, the Soldier knew not where to ſet his Foot with ſafety; for when-ever they ſlipp'd, they were in danger of being loſt, and ſwallow'd up in the depths and precipices which lay hid and cover'd by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61906:211"/>the Snow. Nevertheleſs, the long practice in thoſe Hardſhips and Dangers, taught them to ſuffer all with Conſtancy: But at length coming to a place where neither their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants nor Horſes could paſs, the Way, which was very ſteep before, being now, by the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away of ſome of the Earth, become more difficult, renew'd their Fears; which was manifeſt over the whole Army. Upon this accident, <hi>Hannibal</hi> took a reſolution to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt another way, by taking a compaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe Mountains, tho' there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any paſſage; but foraſmuch as the great Snows render'd that Reſolution too hazardous, all places being cover'd and hid from the view, he therefore chang'd his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>In the interim, there having fallen much new Snow on that which remain'd of the Winter before; this laſt being looſe, and not yet deep, yielded firm footing enough to the Soldiers; but this was no ſooner trampled on, but it diſſolv'd into Dirt and Mire; whereby the Snow of laſt Year being frozen under it, it became impoſſible to march thereon any more than on Ice it ſelf, none being able to keep their Feet; and when they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſuſtain themſelves on their Hands and Knees, they often ſlid and were loſt in Pits and Precipices. When their Horſes at any time ſlip'd, they by their weight and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring broke the Ice under them, and ſo
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61906:211"/>became buried and frozen to Death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hannibal</hi> now deſperate of obtaining his paſſage that way, encamp'd his Army at the entrance of this Paſs, after he had firſt order'd the Snow to be remov'd which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd all the Ground; and then by the labour of his Soldiers he wrought into the Hill it ſelf, and by unſpeakable Pains made his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at length through it: So in one Day he made way for his Horſes and other Beaſts to paſs, which immediately march'd on. And now decamping the Army, he ſent his Horſe and other Beaſts to forrage and recruit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they could come at Paſture, where the Ground was not cover'd with Snow. In the mean time he order'd the <hi>Numidians</hi> to make a paſſage for the Elephants, which coſt them three Days labour with great difficulty to effect; but at length they made way for thoſe Animals, which had ſuffer'd much, and were almoſt dead with Hunger. For there was neither Forage nor Tree to be found on that part of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> nor in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the Ground lying ever cover'd with Snow Winter and Summer, but the lower Grounds on all ſides produce Woods and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and there is no place thereabout that is not habitable.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Hannibal</hi> had united his Troops, he proſecuted his march, and in the ſpace of three Days got paſt theſe difficult and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Places, whereof we have given an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61906:212"/>account, and recover'd the Plains, howbeit with the loſs of great numbers of his People; for many fell by the Enemy, many were drown'd in paſſing the Rivers, and many of Sickneſs, and the Hardſhips of their march to and over the <hi>Alpes.</hi> And as he loſt many Men, ſo his loſs of Horſes and other Beaſts of Burthen, was yet much greater. In a word, after a march of five Months, from his departure from <hi>New-Carthage,</hi> and fifteen Days paſſage over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> he boldly advanc'd into the Champaign Country, lying about the River <hi>Po,</hi> and the Frontiers of the <hi>Inſubrians.</hi> Of the Troops that march'd out with him, there now remain'd, of <hi>Africans</hi> about twelve Thouſand; eight Thouſand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſix Thouſand Horſe, according to his own Regiſter, left by him, engrav'd on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn at <hi>Lacinium,</hi> which ſpecify'd that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. About this time <hi>Publius Cornelius,</hi> who had left his Troops with <hi>Cneius</hi> his Brother, to proſecute the War againſt <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> embark'd for <hi>Piſa,</hi> and from thence paſſing through <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> joyn'd the Armies of the Praetors, who were in ſervice in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt the <hi>Boians;</hi> with theſe he took his march towards the <hi>Po,</hi> where he encamp'd with deſign to come ſpeedily to a Battel with <hi>Hannibal.</hi> And now that we are arriv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> and have tranſlated the War, Armies and Leaders on both ſides thither; it ſeems neceſſary that we preface ſomething to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61906:212"/>Reader, as the order of our Hiſtory requires, before we enter on the account of the Battels and Tranſactions that occurr'd in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. For ſome may poſſibly be apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark and inquire, why, having ſpoken ſo copiouſly of <hi>Spain,</hi> we ſhould have yet ſaid nothing touching other Points of <hi>Geography;</hi> namely, of the <hi>Streight</hi> that parts the two Continents of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> nor of the great neighbouring Sea and its qualities, nor of the Iſlands of <hi>Britany,</hi> nor of their Lead-Mines, their Gold and Silver in <hi>Spain,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Hiſtorians have ſaid ſo much that they contradict one another? But we have not ſpoken of theſe matters, not only becauſe it ſerves to little purpoſe in the uſe of Hiſtory; but firſt, becauſe ſuch digreſſions at every turn are apt to perplex the courſe of our Work, and to divert the Reader's attention from the genuine purpoſe and thread of our Story. Furthermore, our purpoſe being not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſuperficially, and by the bye, of things, but to take them up when they fairly and regularly preſent themſelves, and then ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and duly to deliver the Truth copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and plainly as far as we ſhall be able. Let it not appear ſtrange then, that neither in this place, nor heretofore, we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to touch on many Points as we have ſaid. For if any one fanſies it to be the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Hiſtorian to be taken with every hint that falls in his way, and to touch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61906:213"/>on all Subjects on the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; let ſuch take care leſt they be juſtly compar'd to the Glutton at a Feaſt, who, while his Appetite tempts him to taſte of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Diſh, he receives neither preſent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure nor future Profit; on the contrary, he contracts only ill Digeſtion and worſe Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. People of that Humour, I ſay, in the ſtudy of Hiſtory, have neither preſent Diverſion in the Reading, nor Fruit in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>There are many Vices in Hiſtory, whereof we ſhall mention ſome that ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be reform'd, whereof this we have now nam'd is among the greateſt. Do not all, or moſt part of Hiſtorians, affect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain their Readers with Deſcriptions of the remoteſt parts of the known World, ſetting down the ſituation of Places and Countries, and deſcribing their Nature and the like? Where it is odds, but the greateſt part of them are deceiv'd in many particulars they deliver, it will be but juſt therefore to ſhow them their Faults, and endeavour ſolidly, not ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to refute them, not taking up the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as it were, by chance. The courſe we ſhall take to correct theſe Errors, ſhall not be to blame and inveigh againſt the Authors, but rather in a manner of compaſſion to ſhow candidly wherein they have fail'd through Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. For moſt certain it is, that had they arriv'd at our times, they themſelves
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61906:213"/>would have ſeen things by a better Light, and reform'd much of their own Failures. For there were ſew <hi>Greeks</hi> to be found heretofore, who had over-diligently viſited remote Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not having the means to gratifie their deſires therein; it not being to be compaſs'd in thoſe days, without running extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers both by Sea and Land. Furthermore, if any one by chance, at any time, happen'd of neceſſity to viſit diſtant Countries, even the remoteſt Provinces of the known World, what would the Remarks of a ſingle Traveller amount to? Since it could not be poſſible thoſe Places ſhould be known as they ought, for the greateſt part of thoſe People are Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and Savage, and many parts Deſart, and Inhoſpitable. In ſhort, another difficulty would ſpring through the diverſity of ſtrange Languages, whereby it would hardly be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be rightly inform'd in any thing they ſaw. And albeit People ſhould happen to ſee and learn the ſituation of thoſe Regions, there would be few found whoſe Candor might be truſted, and Men wou'd doubt that much of what they deliver is fabulous, and of their own coining. So hard it is in ſuch caſes not to mingle with Truth, the Tales of their own Invention.</p>
                     <p>Since it ſeems then impoſſible, that our Fore-Fathers could be thorowly inſtructed in all the Subjects of Hiſtory, Authors therefore who have been ſilent in matters, which it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61906:214"/>may be conceiv'd they ought to have better open'd; and even thoſe, who have ſaid more than we find they ought, are however with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much blame, tho' they do not deſerve our praiſe, ſince they were not without ſome tincture of Knowledge, and farther'd in ſome degree the Curioſity of others. But now, in our days, that <hi>Aſia</hi> by the Victories of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> hath been travell'd and diſcover'd, and the Armies of the <hi>Romans</hi> have open'd a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage both by Sea and Land, whereby to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the certain knowledge of the reſt of the World; our Informations come with more certainty of thoſe things, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we could not ſpeak of with aſſurance. Eſpecially in this Age, when many who have been employ'd in the adminiſtration of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, are now releas'd from the cares of both Military and Civil Applications, and have leiſure and means to apply their ſtudies in other curious Speculations. I ſhall ſtrive to do my part at leaſt, when occaſion ſhall ſeaſonably ſerve, to bring things to a better light; and mingle in theſe my Labours ſuch proper Matter as may, to thoſe who delight in this Subject, miniſter to their better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And ſince I have been at the coſt of ſo much time and peril in my Travels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gaul, Africk, Spain,</hi> and on the Ocean that borders on theſe Countries, ſpent in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Knowledge, I hold it not a vain deſign to detect and reform the Miſtakes of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61906:214"/>ancient Authors, by enlarging my Accounts and Deſcriptions of theſe Parts of the World. But it is now time we return to proſecute our Story, and prepare to relate the Battels and Tranſactions of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have already ſet down the number of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Troops, when he made his entry into <hi>Italy.</hi> Who at the end of his march, firſt encamp'd at the foot of the Mountains, to recruit and refreſh his Army, which was not only greatly harraſs'd in their paſſage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Alpes,</hi> but much ſpent through the great ſcarcity of Proviſions in their way, and the Diſeaſes they contracted thereby; many in deſpair neglected their own Preſervation, through the continual Hardſhips and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which they were expos'd: For it was an inſuperable difficulty to find Victuals that might ſuffice for ſo numerous an Army, where many, who were commanded out to provide and bring what they wanted, miſcarry'd, both Men and Beaſts, in their Journey. So that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who paſs'd the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> at the head of eight and thirty Thouſand Foot, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight Thouſand Horſe, muſter'd not half that number at his arrival in <hi>Italy,</hi> as hath been already noted. And thoſe who remain'd ſo chang'd from what they were, that both in Cloths and Countenance they appear'd more like Savages than Soldiers. Wherefore his firſt and chief care was, to reſtore Health
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61906:215"/>and Strength to their Bodies, and Vigour to their Minds, and to recruit and ſtrengthen his Horſe. When his Army was refreſh'd, his next buſineſs was to endeavour an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Taurinians,</hi> who inhabit at the foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and who at that time had War with the <hi>Inſubrians;</hi> but they would not be drawn to truſt the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after having long ſollicited them to Friendſhip in vain, he ſat down before their Capital Town, which in three Days he took, and all that made reſiſtance he put to the Sword; which ſtruck the neighbouring <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> with ſuch terror, that they came all afterwards in to him as one Man, giving themſelves up to his diſcretion. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were conſtrain'd; but the other <hi>Gauls,</hi> who poſſeſs'd the Country about the <hi>Po,</hi> chearfully took part with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as was lately obſerv'd. But in regard now that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was advanc'd ſo near, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur'd not preſently to ſhow their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; but ſome of them were conſtrain'd to take part with them. Whereupon <hi>Hannibal</hi> thought it the wiſeſt way not to deferr lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but to take his March into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; to the end, that by ſome notable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he might eſtabliſh the Courage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Hopes of thoſe who were diſpos'd to engage with him.</p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61906:215"/>
                     <p>During theſe Motions, he receives Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, That the Conſul had paſs'd the <hi>Po</hi> with all the Legions, and was not now far off. But this News he did not preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, inaſmuch as he knew he had left <hi>Scipio</hi> about the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and that the Paſſage by Sea from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was tedious and difficult. Furthermore, he was inform'd, that the March from <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to the <hi>Alpes</hi> was not only long, but hardly to be ſurmounted by an Army. But, in the end, freſh Advices coming daily to him of the truth thereof, he became greatly ſurpriz'd at the Diligence of the <hi>Roman</hi> General, who was no leſs aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at the Expedition of the <hi>Carthaginian:</hi> For he was of Opinion, That <hi>Hannibal</hi> would not have attempted to adventure over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> at the head of an Army compos'd of ſo many divers Nations; or that if he was ſo hardy, he muſt have miſerably periſh'd by the way. But when he became aſſur'd, that they were got over thoſe Difficulties, and were now in <hi>Italy;</hi> and farther, that they had already beſieg'd and taken Towns; he admir'd the intrepid Boldneſs of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whoſe Attempt had exceeded the Power of Imagination it ſelf. This News was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heard at <hi>Rome</hi> with terror enough; where, after they had been inform'd of the taking of <hi>Saguntum</hi> by the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> and while they were, as it were, deliberating to ſend one of their Conſuls into <hi>Africk</hi> to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61906:216"/>attack <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the other into <hi>Spain</hi> to make War on <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they receiv'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf was in <hi>Italy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging of Towns. This was ſo ſurprizing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the dread thereof made them ſend an expreſs to <hi>Tiberius</hi> now at <hi>Lily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeum,</hi> to acquaint him with the arrival of the Enemy, and to enjoin him to poſtpone all other Affairs whatſoever, and repair with all the expedition he could to the reſcue of his Country. Whereupon <hi>Tiberius</hi> aſſembles his Maritime Forces, and embarks forthwith for <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving his Orders with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Tribunes, to draw together what Troops they could out of their ſeveral Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and ſet them a Day to rendezvous at <hi>Rimini,</hi> a Town ſtanding on the Coaſt of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> on the edge of the Plains that are water'd by the River <hi>Po</hi> towards the South. So that great trouble and tumult was ſpread all over the Country; which being alarm'd on all Quarters with evil Tidings, the <hi>Romans</hi> were in great ſuſpence about the iſſue of the War.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> drew near each other; and mutually animating their Soldiers, ſpake to them in ſuch terms as the time and the occaſion requir'd. <hi>Hannibal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited his Troops after this, or the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: He caus'd to be brought to the head of the Army, which he had aſſembled for that purpoſe, certain young Men who were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61906:216"/>of the number of thoſe that had been taken vexing and plundering the Army in their march over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> whom he had therefore kept in very hard durance. In ſhort, they appear'd loaden with Irons, ſtarv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to death, bearing on their naked Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the marks of the ill treatment they had ſuffer'd. In this ſtate theſe Wretches were preſented to the view of the Army; where Arms were brought and laid before them, ſuch as were us'd among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and not unlike thoſe the Princes of that Nation make uſe of in their ſingle Combats: Beſides theſe, there were produc'd Horſes, and rich Habits and Furniture. Then it was demanded, If any among them were willing to engage and fight one with the other to the death, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Vanquiſher ſhould have the Prize and the Reward there propos'd, while the Vanquiſh'd thereby put an end to his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, by laying down his Life on the place? Which Propoſition they all unanimouſly cry'd out they were moſt willing to accept. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hannibal</hi> order'd a certain number to be choſen by lot to enter the Liſts, two and two, each imploring Fortune's favour. Thoſe to whom the Lots <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ell manifeſted great joy, while the others, on the contrary, exceeding Grief. So they fought it out, while the reſt of the Priſoners look'd on the Vanquiſh'd, as hardly leſs fortunate than the Victors, having by their death put a period to the Miſeries
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61906:217"/>they endur'd. Nor had the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> themſelves other Sentiments; who comparing the Life of thoſe that ſurviv'd, with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe they ſaw ſlain, their Pity ſeem'd to encline to the Survivers, conceiving the Dead to be of the two the leaſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Hannibal</hi> had entertain'd his Army with this Spectacle, he told them, That his purpoſe in ſo treating thoſe Priſoners, was to inſtruct them, by an Example of the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others, in the Contingences of Human Life, and to the end to mind them of the State and Circumſtances wherein they now were; for that, in a word, Fortune had now put them under the very ſame choice, and held out the ſame Prize and Rewards: That they were ty'd up to the ſame neceſſity of vanquiſhing, dying, or being made Captives to their Enemies: That if they obtain'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, not fine Horſes only magnificently furniſh'd, wou'd be their Lot, but, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the <hi>Romans,</hi> they would be the richeſt and happieſt of all that ever had born Arms: That if they chanc'd to die doing their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bravely, ſuch a Death was a Dignity full of Glory and Renown; a Death without pain or fear, and purchas'd in purſuit of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Good that can happen to Mankind: But ſhould they chance to be vanquiſh'd, and that the fear of Death or Danger ſhould betray them to a baſe Flight; or if they had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61906:217"/>any Thought otherwiſe to be ſafe, they muſt then determine to endure the laſt effects of Miſery and Misfortune. He ſaid, There could be none among them ſo weak or ſtupid, who, reflecting on the tedious and terrible March they had had from their Native Homes thither, the many Perils, Combats, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rencounters they had paſs'd, the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rivers they had Forded, and the like Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their paſſage, can have the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of expectation by ſlight, ever to return back: And that ſince that Hope was totally extinguiſh'd, they would do well to have the ſame Motions of Compaſſion of their own Fortune, as they entertain'd but now for that of others. For as they eſteem'd the Condition of the Victors and the Vanquiſh'd equal, or rather ſaw cauſe to pity the Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they could do no leſs for themſelves than fight bravely; chiefly indeed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, but to die rather than not Overcome: For ſhould it be their hap to be Vanquiſh'd, there would be no hopes of living; but if they could with determination imprint theſe Reſlections in their Minds, there would be no doubt of Succeſs, nor fear but they ſhould live to enjoy the Fruits of it. That, in a word, none ever brought ſuch Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them into the Field, whether out of their own Temper or Neceſſity, that were not crown'd with Victory. That the <hi>Romans</hi> hitherto had to deal with Enemies otherwiſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61906:218"/>than ſo inſpir'd, who, for the moſt part, plac'd their Safety in flight, by reaſon they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ought in the neighbourhood of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was their refuge; and by which means they wanted Reſolution to ſuſtain the ſhock of Danger like an Enemy ſtrengthen'd by Deſpair. <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army heard with chearfulneſs the diſcourſe he made them, and manifeſted their Minds to be ſuch as their Captain himſelf deſir'd. He therefore high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauded their generous Behaviour, and after he had told them, they ſhould be in a readineſs to march early on the Morrow, he diſmiſs'd the Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> had now paſs'd the <hi>Po,</hi> and becauſe he deſign'd to advance further, he caus'd a Bridge to be made over the <hi>Teſin.</hi> And drawing the Army together, he told them many things touching the Dignity and Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi>-State, and of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Actions of their Anceſtors. But take the relation (a little more or leſs) of what he deliver'd on that occaſion. He told them, That tho' it might have ſo happen'd, that they had never yet try'd the Enemy they had now to deal with, they ſhould neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have reaſon to rely on Victory; but ſince they were to fight againſt <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they ought to hold it an inſupportable Indignity to the Name of a <hi>Roman,</hi> that People ſo often by them beaten, and who had been ſo long their Tributaries, and bred to Servitude,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61906:218"/>ſhould preſume to look with an angry Eye on a <hi>Roman. But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſince we have learn'd by many glorious Experiments, that this Enemy will never have aſſurance to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure our approach; What ought we not to hope, if things are rightly weigh'd? How lately was it prov'd, that their Horſe is inferiour to ours? which beat them at the</hi> Rhoſne, <hi>and, after killing many, purſu'd the reſt to their Camp.</hi> He told them, That the General, and the reſt of the Army, having had News of the approach of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, had retreated as if they ſled, and the Terror they were in had compell'd them ſore againſt their Wills to attempt paſſing the <hi>Alpes</hi> back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. He farther told them, That <hi>Hannibal</hi> was come with but an handful of Men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt the greateſt part of his Army in his March; and that thoſe he had with him were ſo harraſs'd and weaken'd with Diſeaſes, and the Hardſhips they had ſuffer'd, that they were totally diſabled for Service. He farther told them, That the greateſt part of their Horſe were loſt and made unſerviceable by the broken and ſtony ways they had march'd through. He endeavour'd, by the like ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions to perſwade the Army, that the ſhowing themſelves only would be enough to obtain the Victory; and that furthermore, barely to behold the Enemy they had to deal with, would inſpire them with Contempt. He ſaid, in ſhort, That he would not have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61906:219"/>quitted the Fleet, nor his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Expedition, whither he had been commanded to go, nor would have taken his March ſo willingly, had he not been firmly convine'd, by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Reaſons, that the Journey he had undertaken was greatly for the Good of his Country, and that the Victory was certain. And now, being a Man of great Account and Authority, and it ſeeming to them that what he ſaid was true, the Army with great Ardour and Reſolution, demanded to be led againſt the Enemy. So after having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their Chearfulneſs, and made them an Exhortation to be always in a Poſture to receive his farther Commands, he diſmiſs'd them.</p>
                     <p>On the Morrow theſe two Captains began their March along the River, towards that part which regards the Mountains: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> on the Left, the others on the Right. The next Day, receiving News by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Foragers, that the Armies drew near, they both thought good to encamp where they were, and intrench themſelves. But the next Morning <hi>Hannibal,</hi> at the head of his whole Body of Horſe, and <hi>Scipio</hi> with his, to whom they joyn'd their Archers, took the Field; both wiſhing to ſee each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And they no ſooner perceiv'd by the Duſt that was rais'd, that the Groſs on each ſide drew near, when they began to range themſelves in order of Battel. <hi>Scipio</hi> put his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61906:219"/>Darters in the Van, and mix'd the <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Horſe among them, and having ordered the reſt Front-wiſe, mov'd ſlowly on. As for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he plac'd his Horſe that went with a ſingle Bridle in the Van-guard, together with all the other choſen Horſe he had, and ſo advanc'd againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> He had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe plac'd his <hi>Numidians</hi> on the Wings, to the end he might be able to come to attack the <hi>Romans</hi> Flank, and ſo ſurround them. And as the Leaders on both ſides, and the Troops they commanded, were eager to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, they ſoon came to Blows. But ſcarce had the <hi>Roman</hi> Darters deliver'd their firſt Volley, when terrify'd with the Violence of the Enemies Charge, and fearing to be trod and run down by the Horſe which advane'd, they retir'd in haſte through the Intervals of their Battel, among their Horſe. Thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that came to ingage hand to hand fought with Reſolution on both ſides, and equal Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very a good ſpace, and the diſpute ſeem'd no other than between Horſe and Foot mingled, for many in the heat of the Battel alighted and fought on Foot. But when the <hi>Numidians,</hi> by taking a compaſs had got on the <hi>Romans</hi> Flank, the Darters, who had retreated thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as was obſerv'd, were ſorely ſtreighten'd and ſoon defeated, the <hi>Numidians</hi> having in' compaſs'd the greateſt part of them. And now, at length, thoſe in the Van, on the part of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who before ſtood ſo firm,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61906:220"/>having loſt many Men, who had ſold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at a good Price, were likewiſe driven to give ground upon the <hi>Numidians,</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Flank.</p>
                     <p>Many made their eſcape, ſome one way, ſome another; ſome rally'd about the Conſul, who forthwith decamp'd from about the <hi>Teſin,</hi> and led his Troops towards the Bridge over the <hi>Po,</hi> with intention to paſs there; for as the Champaign Country in thoſe Parts is of great extent, and that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſtronger in Horſe, <hi>Scipio</hi> for that reaſon labour'd to lead the Legions into ſome ſafer and more proper Country; and the rather, for that he was himſelf indiſpos'd of a Wound he receiv'd in the Battel. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſtaid ſome time in expectation the Legions would have appear'd; but after he underſtood that the <hi>Romans</hi> had abandon'd their Camp, he follow'd them in the Rear as far as the Bridge, which he found broken, where he took about ſix hundred Priſoners of thoſe that were left there on the Guard. And being told that the reſt of the Army were now march'd a good diſtance off, he led his Troops up along the River in ſearch of a proper place where he might make a Bridge; and, after two Days march, having found means to make one of Boats, he order'd <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> to lead over the Army, paſſing himſelf likewiſe; there he gave Audience to ſundry Ambaſſadors, who came to him from ſeveral places. For the bruit of his Victory
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61906:220"/>was no ſooner ſpread, when all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Gauls</hi> became diſpos'd to declare for the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> and, as it had been before ſuggeſted, they now courted their Friendſhip, ſupplying them with whatever they wanted, and offering frankly to joyn their Forces, and take part in their Adventures. <hi>Hannibal</hi> gave courteous Reception to thoſe who were come with theſe Tenders, and after the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had paſs'd the River, he led them back down the Stream, and march'd with great Diligence to intercept the Enemy. But <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Scipio,</hi> after he had paſs'd the <hi>Po,</hi> march'd directly to <hi>Placentia,</hi> a Colony of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> where he ſtaid among the reſt who were hurt in the Battel, to attend the cure of his Wounds, and believing the Army to be now in Safety, he there remain'd without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempting any thing. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> arriving in two Days after he had paſs'd the River, drew out his Army the next Day in Battalia in view of the Enemy; but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> not offering to ſtir, he retir'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd about ten Miles off.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who bore Arms under the <hi>Romans,</hi> beholding Fortune now to declare in favour of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated by common Conſent to deſert their Service, but continu'd quiet in their Tents, waiting the time to put their purpoſe in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. And now, when the Army was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in their Quarters, about the fourth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61906:221"/>Watch they put themſelves into Arms, and falling on the <hi>Romans</hi> that were neareſt at hand, kill'd many, and wounded many more, and cutting off the Heads of thoſe they had murder'd, march'd to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to the number of two Thouſand Foot, and two Hundred Horſe. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by the kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he gave them, manifeſted how wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Action was to him; and, after he had with great gentleneſs invited them into his Service, and with ample Promiſes to every one according to his degree, he gave them leave to retire for the preſent to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Habitations, thereby to ſpread the Fame of his Actions, and to win over others to the Service and Friendſhip of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> And he had reaſon to conclude, they would now be conſtrain'd for the moſt part to come in to him, after ſo perſidious an act done by their Country-men. At the ſame time Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors came to him from the <hi>Boians,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them a Preſent of the three <hi>Roman</hi> Commiſſioners they had taken (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) on the breaking out of the War, who had been deputed for the dividing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the Lands in their Colonies. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> gratefully receiv'd their Meſſage, and their Offer, and enter'd into Confederacy with them; but reſtor'd back the Priſoners to their keeping, adviſing them to ſecure them under a ſafe Guard, whereby to redeem their Hoſtages, as they had formerly propos'd.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61906:221"/>
                        <hi>Sciplo</hi> much lamented the loſs of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had been cut off by ſo vile an Act of Treachery; and rightly judging that the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who of a long time had nouriſh'd an inbred Averſion to the <hi>Romans,</hi> would (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the neighbouring Countries, after having acted ſo criminal a Part) go over to the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> he therefore thought it Wiſdom, for the time to come, to be more on his guard touching that People. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he decamp'd about the fourth Watch of the Night following, and march'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd near the River <hi>Trebia,</hi> upon certain Eminences not far off, reſting pretty well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of the ſtrength of the ſituation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the neighbourhood of many of their Allies. <hi>Hannibal</hi> getting intelligence of the motions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſent his <hi>Numidians</hi> in purſuit of them; after theſe march'd the whole Horſe of the Army, and himſelf with the Groſs ſoon follow'd them. The <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> coming to the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, and finding it empty, ſtay'd to ſet it on fire, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avail'd the <hi>Romans</hi> in their retreat: For the Horſe, but for this delay caus'd by the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> had certainly overtaken the <hi>Romans</hi> before they had paſs'd the Plains; in which caſe they undoubtedly had been very much expos'd. But foraſmuch as the <hi>Roman</hi> Army had now time to paſs over the <hi>Trebia,</hi> the Enemy coming ſhort, had only the occaſion left them of attacking their Rear-guard,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61906:222"/>whereof ſome were ſlain, and others made Priſoners. <hi>Scipio</hi> then having thus compaſs'd his Paſſage over the River, encamp'd, I ſay, on high ground not far from it; and intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf there, attended the coming of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the Legions that were with him, uſing all poſſible care and skill to get well of his Wounds, that he might be in a ſtate to give the Enemy ſpeedy Battel. But <hi>Hannibal,</hi> arriving two Days after he had paſs'd the River, drew up his Army in view of the <hi>Romans;</hi> who not being diſpos'd to engage him, he march'd away, and encamp'd ſix Miles off; the <hi>Gauls</hi> (who had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd Courage by the hopes he had given them) ſupplying him with Proviſions in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and all things elſe of which he ſtood in need, being determin'd to ſhare with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in all that ſhould befal them. When the News came to <hi>Rome</hi> of the Battel of the Horſe, they were aſtoniſh'd at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the iſſue, as expecting quite other ſucceſs; but they comforted themſelves with many Reaſons to conclude, that at leaſt they were not quite vanquiſh'd in that occaſion. Some took leave to blame the Temerity of their Leader; and others rag'd againſt the perfidious <hi>Gauls:</hi> But, in a word, while they were aſſur'd that their Legions were entire, and had ſuffer'd nothing, they were reſolv'd to abate nothing of their Hopes. And when <hi>Tiberius Sempronius</hi> arriv'd, and they beheld
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61906:222"/>his Troops paſs through the City, they were perſuaded, That ſuch an Army by barely ſhowing themſelves to the Enemy, would do enough to vanquiſh them. When the Troops were rendezvous'd at <hi>Rimini,</hi> purſuant to the Orders they had receiv'd, and that they had taken the cuſtomary Oath, the Conſul march'd forthwith in queſt of <hi>Scipio;</hi> and as ſoon as he arriv'd, he encamp'd by him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care to refreſh his Soldiers, who had had a tedious Voyage of forty Days betwixt <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> and <hi>Rimini.</hi> In the mean ſpace, Preparations were making to fight the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; during which time, <hi>Tiberius</hi> never departed from <hi>Scipio,</hi> informing himſelf of every thing that had paſs'd, and deliberating with him about what was beſt farther to be done.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time <hi>Hannibal</hi> became poſſeſs'd of <hi>Claſtidium,</hi> which he got by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, the Town being deliver'd up to him by one <hi>Publius</hi> a <hi>Brunduſian,</hi> who had receiv'd the Government from the <hi>Romans.</hi> Here <hi>Hannibal</hi> found ſtore of Corn, which he now ſtood in great need of: The Pris'ners he took with him, whom he treated with lenity enough; endeavouring to make ſhow by that Action, of the gentle uſage thoſe might hope from him; who tho' they had taken part with the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhould ſo deliver themſelves up to his diſcretion, and to the end they might with leſs apprehenſion reſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61906:223"/>to his Clemency. He treated likewiſe the treacherous Governor with great reſpect, and rewarded him magnificently, the better to work upon others to do the like, who had any charge under the <hi>Romans.</hi> And now receiving Intelligence, That certain <hi>Gauls</hi> his Confederates, inhabiting between the <hi>Po</hi> and the <hi>Trebia,</hi> held ſecret Commerce with the <hi>Romans,</hi> (who, it ſeems, conceiv'd, that by covertly favouring both Parties, they ſhould be able to inſure their Safety either way) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe he ſent a Detachment of about two thouſand Foot, and a thouſand <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> and <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Horſe, who punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd their Orders, ravaging the Country, and taking much Booty. Whereupon the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſo treated, apply'd to the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſuccour and ſecure them. <hi>Sempronius,</hi> who had long thirſted after an occaſion to come to action; having now found it, forthwith orders the major part of his Horſe, and about a thouſand Darters to march, who fall on the <hi>Numidians</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> that were ſtill pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging the Country on the other ſide the <hi>Trebia,</hi> taking them by ſurprize, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any order, and while they were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt among themſelves about ſharing their Plunder; and being too hard for them, beat and purſu'd them to their Camp. But they were no ſooner diſcover'd from the Rampart, when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> taking the Alarm, ſally'd to their relief, and made the <hi>Romans</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61906:223"/>in their turn to ſhow their Backs, and haſten to their Camp. Which being obſerv'd by <hi>Sempronius,</hi> he commanded out all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry and Darters he had, who oblig'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to return as haſtily as they came, and cover themſelves in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was not yet ready to come to a Battel, and believ'd that he ought not to hazard all at one haſty Caſt, and without mature Deliberation, behav'd himſelf in this Rencounter in ſuch manner, as that all the World muſt own, became a Great General: For contenting himſelf bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make thoſe who had ſled into the Camp, to face about and make head againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he then ſounded a retreat, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to purſue the <hi>Romans,</hi> or longer to engage. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſtood their ground for a ſpace; and after they had ſuſtain'd ſome loſs themſelves, but done greater execution on the Enemy, they retir'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sempronius</hi> being inflam'd by this ſucceſs, his Paſſion grew yet greater to come to a Battel, and decide at once the Fortune of the War. And albeit he was determin'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt his utmoſt, by his ſingle Authority, during <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Indiſpoſition; yet becauſe it would be a mighty pleaſure to him to have his Colleague's Concurrence, he imparted his Deſign to him; but found him not of his Opinion. <hi>Scipio</hi> told him, That the new
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61906:224"/>untrain'd Soldiers would be better in the Spring, if care were taken to exerciſe them during the Winter, and accuſtom them to Military Duties: And if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted nothing further, and were driven to be quiet for a while, the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally an inconſtant People, it was likely would once again deſert them. Furthermore he told him, That as ſoon as Strength would enable him, he had ſomething to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which would much redound to the Service of his Country. With theſe and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Reaſons it was, that <hi>Publius</hi> ſought to prevail on <hi>Sempronius</hi> not to engage in any hazardous Enterprize. And <hi>Sempronius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could not but ſee, that the Counſel was wholeſome which <hi>Scipio</hi> propounded; but, blinded with Ambition, and a good Opinion of his own Sufficiency, he reſolv'd to do his utmoſt to be at the head of ſome Action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Colleague could be able to appear in the Field, and the new Election of Conſuls ſhould be made, which now drew near. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch then as ſince he found he could not accommodate the Occaſion to his purpoſe, and was yet reſolv'd to bend it to his Will, he ſoon made it viſible, that nothing was likely to be prudently done under his Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that things would run a mighty hazard. On the other hand, <hi>Hannibal</hi> thought as <hi>Scipio</hi> did, touching the preſent poſture of Affairs, and therefore ſought all occaſions to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61906:224"/>come to a Battel. For as he was willing to make uſe of the forwardneſs the <hi>Gauls</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, while there Minds were yet unſhaken; ſo he well knew, that the ſooner he fought, the rawer his Enemy would be with whom he was to engage, the Army being, for the moſt part, compos'd of young new-rais'd Men. Furthermore, <hi>Scipio</hi> he knew conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd indiſpos'd of his Wounds: And, in a word, what was yet of greater weight, he thought it not ſafe to remain long without Action. For who ſo enters with an Army into a Foreign Country, and hath great Deſigns to execute, hath but one way to ſucceed and be ſecure; namely, by inceſſantly engaging in new and ſignal Enterprizes, whereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and ſupport the Courage and Hopes of his Friends. <hi>Hannibal</hi> then obſerving <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi>'s precipitate forwardneſs to come to a Battel, did all he could on his part to gratifie him.</p>
                     <p>When he had carefully ſurvey'd the Plain that lay between the two Camps, tho' he found it for the moſt part very level, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he diſcover'd certain Places proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for laying of Ambuſhes. In ſhort, there was a Brook hard by, the Banks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were ſomewhat rais'd above the level of the Plain, and over-grown with Buſhes and Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which place he reſolv'd to make uſe of to execute what he had in his Mind to do; and he concluded his Deſign was the more
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61906:225"/>promiſing by how much the <hi>Romans</hi> were only jealous of the Woods and Foreſt, and Places of Covert, which the <hi>Gauls</hi> for the moſt part made choice of for their Ambuſhes, but thought themſelves ſafe from that danger in bare and open Countries; not conſidering that ſuch ſituations often yield better and ſafer means to form ſuch Deſigns than the thickeſt Woods. For, in ſhort, thoſe who are ſo lodg'd are better able to look about them, and diſcover from far all that paſſes, and there is often ſound in ſuch Plains riſing Ground and Eminences ſit to cover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal Men; nor is there hardly any River or Brook ſo ſmall that hath not ſome kind of ſelter on the Banks, that are for the moſt part cover'd too with Shrubs and Brambles, and the like Under-wood, where Foot may be very eaſily conceal'd, and even Horſe alſo with a little care, by grounding their Arms, which are otherwiſe diſcover'd at a diſtance. After <hi>Hannibal</hi> then had held a Council of War, where his Brother <hi>Mago,</hi> and the reſt of his Principal Officers were preſent, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate about the Battel which they expected would be ſpeedily ſought, where they all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of what he had therein propos'd; and, while the Army refreſh'd themſelves, he took his Brother to conferr with apart, (who was a gallant young Man, and train'd from his Childhood to Arms) to whom he firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed an hundred choſen Horſe, and the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61906:225"/>like number of ſelect Foot, for his Guard; then he order'd him, before it was dark, to pick out a certain number of the braveſt Men he could find in the whole Army, whom he ſhould direct to aſſemble, and attend at his Tent after Supper for further Orders. At the time appointed they appear, where, after he had exhorted them to the well-performance of their Duty, and obſerv'd their chearful Behaviour, he commanded them to ſort themſelves by two and two, each one to chuſe for his Companion the Man he beſt lov'd, and moſt truſted: Theſe he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to draw together, and aſſemble in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place he appointed in the Camp. After theſe Orders were executed, <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of theſe drew out a thouſand Horſe, and the like number of Foot, with Inſtruction to <hi>Mago</hi> how to put his Orders in execution, and then privily diſpatch'd them away during the Night, accompany'd with proper Guides to the Place of Ambuſh. Early in the Morning <hi>Hannibal</hi> aſſembled all his <hi>Numidians,</hi> a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and indeſatigable People; theſe, after he had well encourag'd and fairly promis'd to each one Rewards in proportion to his Merit, he commanded to march out, and brave the Enemy in the Camp, with Directions, that as ſoon as they ſhould draw out to engage them, and they had began to Pickeer, that they ſhould then retire back over the River. His deſign being laid to ſurprize the <hi>Romans</hi>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61906:226"/>into a Battel faſting, and not ſo well prepar'd for the buſineſs as they ought. Then he directed the reſt of the Army (after his uſual Exhortation) to take a good repaſt, and be ready under their Arms, and with their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ready to march.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sempronius</hi> the next Morning no ſooner ſaw the <hi>Numidians</hi> approach when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, with Orders to attack them; to ſuſtain theſe he order'd out ſix thouſand Darters, and at length march'd the whole Army out of the Camp: For he had conceiv'd ſuch an aſſurance in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he had, and was become ſo bold by his late Succeſs, that he reckon'd, the ſhow only of ſuch a Body of Men would go far towards a Victory. And now it may be noted, that as the Winter was not yet quite paſt, ſo the Day was ſnowy and very cold. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the <hi>Romans,</hi> both Horſe and Foot, had been made to march out of their Camp moſt of them faſting; inſomuch as the ſame Army that took the Field ſo forwardly began ſoon to ſhrink: For when they came to ford the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which was much ſwell'd with the Rain of the Night before, the Water was Breaſt-high, ſo that the <hi>Romans</hi> thus contending at once with Hunger and Cold, (for the Day was now well advanc'd) began to ſink in their Courage, and abate in their Strength; while the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on the contrary had taken a plentiful repaſt in their Tents, and were
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61906:226"/>well fortify'd with Meat and Drink, and had anointed their Bodies before they put on their Arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had long waited the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſeeing the Enemy now over the River, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Baleares</hi> to advance with the reſt of the light-arm'd Troops, to the number of eight thouſand Men, to ſuſtain them. And having march'd about a Mile from his Camp, he drew up his Army in Battalia; his Line of Foot conſiſting of <hi>Spaniards, Gauls</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> amounted to about twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; his Horſe, which he plac'd on the Wings, to above ten thouſand, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe which had been ſent by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> his Confederates; his Elephants he plac'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd before the two Points of the Battel. In the mean time <hi>Sempronius</hi> order'd a Retreat to be founded to draw off his Horſe, who were totally to ſeek how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt this new Enemy, with whom they had to do: For they engag'd againſt <hi>Numidians,</hi> whoſe way was to retreat in haſte, and to break and diſperſe themſelves, and to rally again with eaſe, and return bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Charge when they were leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, which is the <hi>Numidian</hi> manner of ſighting. As to the Foot, <hi>Tiberius</hi> had drawn them up after the <hi>Roman</hi> Order. There march'd in this Expedition ſixteen thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, and twenty thouſand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. For when ever their Armies repreſented
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61906:227"/>(as one may ſay) the Body of the Republick, and that both the Conſuls joyn'd their Troops on any preſſing occaſion, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army conſiſted of that number. In ſhort, <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> poſted his Horſe on the Wings, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to about four Thouſand, and with a proud Port and ſlow motion advanc'd in good order againſt the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The two Armies now drawing near, the light-arm'd Troops, who were advanc'd a good diſtance before the Lines of Battel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the fight. It was viſible from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the <hi>Romans</hi> fought with diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and that on the other hand the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> had every thing conſpiring in their Favour. For the <hi>Roma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> Darters who had been harraſs'd all the Morning till then, had ſpent almoſt all their Ammunition againſt the <hi>Numidians,</hi> and what remain'd was now wet and ſpoil'd. Their Horſe and the reſt of their Army was not in a much better condition, while the Enemy was in every thing ſuperior; for, coming into the Battel freſh and vigorous, they perform'd their Duty more chearfully, and with greater readineſs obey'd the Orders of their Leaders. Wherefore, as ſoon as they had ſecur'd the retreat of their light-arm'd Troops, and the advanc'd Parties that began the Battel, and their groſs and heavy-arm'd Troops came to ingage, the <hi>Romans,</hi> not able to ſuſtain the firſt Charge of the Enemy's Horſe, which not only outnumber'd theirs,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61906:227"/>but were likewiſe in better plight (as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) beat them from their Poſt; ſo that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Flanks of their Foot now uncover'd, the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Pikes, and a Party of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> who were poſted near their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and had out-march'd the reſt of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, fell on the Points of the <hi>Romans</hi> Battel, whom they ſo hard preſs'd, that they diſabled them from making head againſt thoſe who charg'd them in Front: Nevertheleſs, their heavy-arm'd Troops every where, in the firſt and ſecond Ranks, fought it at hand for a while with doubtful Bravery.</p>
                     <p>But the Ambuſh of <hi>Numidians</hi> now riſing, and falling unlook'd for on the backs of the <hi>Romans</hi> who were got beyond them, put them into great diſorder. And thoſe on the two Points of the <hi>Roman</hi> Battel, finding themſelves preſs'd in Front by the Elephants, and in Flank by the light-arm'd Troops, no longer able to ſuſtain it, forſook their Ground, and flying were purſu'd by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to the River. In a word, the <hi>Numidian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh coming to Charge the Rear of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Battel, ſlew many of them: While thoſe in the firſt Ranks, animated by neceſſity, charg'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> and ſome <hi>Africans,</hi> with whom they had to deal, with great Reſolution, and killing many, broke the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Battalion. Nevertheleſs, when they beheld the two Points naked, and defeated, being now without hope of ſuccouring them, or of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61906:228"/>being able to gain their Camp, by reaſon of the multitude of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horſe, which greatly terrify'd them, and the Rivers being alſo much riſen by the Rains that had fallen; by which Impediments deſpairing to gain their Camp, they ſafely retreated to the number of ten Thouſand to <hi>Placentia;</hi> the greateſt part of the reſt being ſlain on the Banks of the River <hi>Trebia,</hi> partly by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants, and partly by the Enemies Horſe; ſome few Foot only, and a good Party of Horſe eſcaping; who following the reſt, got likewiſe into <hi>Placentia.</hi> As to the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> after they had purſu'd the Enemy to the River, not being able for exceſſive cold to follow them further, they retir'd to their Camp. There was great joy in the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Army on the occaſion of this Succeſs; for their loſs fell not heavy either on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Africans,</hi> but moſtly on the <hi>Gauls:</hi> Howbeit, they had ſuffer'd ſo much by the Snow, and the extream rigour of the Weather, that many Men and Horſes dy'd afterwards of Cold, and all their Elephants ſave one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sempronius</hi> was not ignorant of the great conſequence of this Defeat, but was willing however to hide it all he could from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; accordingly, he ſent his Diſpatches to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he gave them to underſtand, that the ſeverity of the Weather had ſnatch'd the Victory out of his hands. This the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61906:228"/>were at firſt willing to believe; but when they underſtood ſoon after, That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were poſſeſs'd of their Camp; That the <hi>Gauls</hi> from all Quarters had revolted to them; and, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers were ſcatter'd here and there after the Battel, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves in the neighbouring Towns, and that they had no ſubſiſtence but what was convey'd to them by Water up the <hi>Po;</hi> they then became better inſtructed how to reckon of the iſſue of that Battel. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, tho' their Affairs had ſo ill ſucceeded, contrary to the expectation of all the World, they proceeded to new Preparations for the War; they conſulted how to ſecure ſuch Places as were in the neighbourhood of the Enemy; they determin'd to diſpatch Forces into <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſupply'd <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> and other proper places with good Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Furthermore, they equipp'd and ſent to Sea a Fleet of ſixty Ships. <hi>Cn. Servilius</hi> and <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> alſo, who were the new Conſuls, rais'd Levies among their Allies, and made proviſion of Victual, which they ſent to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> and into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> with ſhow of purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſend Troops into thoſe Parts. They likewiſe demanded Supplies of <hi>Hieron,</hi> who ſent them five Hundred <hi>Candiots,</hi> and a Thouſand Buckler-men. Thus with mighty providence they proceeded in all neceſſary Preparations; and it muſt be confeſs'd of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they are every way a terrible
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61906:229"/>Enemy, even when they are moſt terrify'd and menac'd with Danger.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Tranſactions in <hi>Italy, Cn. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> to whom his Brother had given the Command of the Naval Army, (as we have elſewhere noted) landed on the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſomewhere not far from the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pories;</hi> where ſhowing his Army, he coaſted along as far as the <hi>Eber,</hi> reducing ſuch by force as made reſiſtance, and receiving with ſingular Humanity into his protection, ſuch as voluntarily came in; and took care, above all things, that the Army offer'd violence to none. And after he had ſecur'd, by good Garriſons, ſuch Places as he had brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obedience of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he march'd further up into the Country with his whole Army, having been reinforc'd with new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliaries, which he levy'd among the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> taking in all Places by force that lay in the way of his march. In the mean time, <hi>Hanno,</hi> who Commanded for the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in theſe Parts, obſerving the progreſs <hi>Scipio</hi> made, preſently march'd his Army, and came and encamp'd cloſe by him, not far from the City of <hi>Ciſſa.</hi> Whereupon they came to a Battel, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were beaten, the <hi>Romans</hi> taking very much Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thoſe who had march'd with <hi>Hannibal</hi> having (as we noted) left the greateſt part of their Subſtance in their keeping. He made Alliance alſo, Offenſive and Defenſive, with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61906:229"/>all thoſe on this ſide the River <hi>Eber. Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General. was taken Priſoner, together with <hi>Indibilis</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had uſurp'd Kingly Authority over thoſe who inhabited the inland Country, and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a particular and faſt Affection for the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Adventure, he paſs'd the <hi>Eber</hi> to come to the ſuccour of his Party; but in the interim receiving advice, That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Sea-men belonging to the Fleet behav'd themſelves negligently, being grown careleſs and preſumptuous on the ſucceſs of their Land-Forces, he march'd firſt againſt them, taking with him eight Thouſand of his beſt Foot, and a Thouſand Horſe; and finding the <hi>Romans</hi> diſpers'd and ſcatter'd about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he fell upon them, killing the greateſt part, and purſuing the reſt to their Fleet. But he attempted nothing further, but march'd back the way he came; and repaſſing the <hi>Eber,</hi> remain'd the Winter at <hi>New-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> where he made all neceſſary proviſion to ſuſtain the War, and for the defence of the Towns on that ſide the River. As to <hi>Cn. Scipio,</hi> as ſoon as he was come back to the Fleet, he there animadverted on thoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Roman</hi> Law of Diſcipline, who he found had been guilty of the occaſion of that Defeat: And after he had drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and embody'd all his Forces by Sea and Land, he march'd, and kept his Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61906:230"/>at <hi>Tarracona.</hi> He divided the Booty that had been taken among the Soldiers, by which he greatly gain'd their Good-will, and eſtabliſh'd in them a more chearful Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Obedience to ſuch future Orders as the Service ſhould make neceſſary. Thus we have ſet down the ſtate of Affairs at that time in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Early the following Spring, <hi>Cn. Flaminius</hi> led the Legions through <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and came to <hi>Arezzo,</hi> where he encamp'd. But <hi>Cn. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius</hi> march'd to <hi>Rimini,</hi> to do his beſt to ſhut up the Enemy's paſſage that way. As to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he held his Winter-Quarters in the <hi>Ciſalpine Gaul,</hi> where he us'd his <hi>Roman</hi> Priſoners with great rigour; for over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their being under ſevere reſtraint, their Suſtenance was diſpens'd to them very parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly; while, on the other hand, their Allies, who, tho' they were likewiſe Priſoners, were us'd however with all poſſible Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Theſe he caus'd to be aſſembled, where he told them, That he had undertaken a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>Italy,</hi> not to moleſt or make War on them, but to fight their Battels againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> and remonſtrated to them, That if they knew how to conſult their own Good, they would do well to court his Friendſhip: That his chief end was to reſtore Liberty to the <hi>Italians,</hi> and to re-eſtabliſh the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the Towns and Villages, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had injuriouſly diſpoſſeſs'd. After
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61906:230"/>this, he diſmiſs'd them, and order'd them all to be enlarg'd Ranſom-free, the better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to engage the People of <hi>Italy</hi> to his Party, and to alienate them from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to animate ſuch againſt them to whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had done any late violence, by ſeizing any Town or Sea-Port.</p>
                     <p>He had likewiſe meditated during the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, another piece of <hi>African</hi>-Craft; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well inſtructed in the <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Levity, and apprehenſive leſt they ſhould form any ſecret Deſign on his Life, his Friendſhip with them being yet but new, he caus'd Peruques to be made of ſundry ſorts, and for divers Ages; than which nothing diſguiſeth more, even to a degree of rendring People totally Strangers to one another; of theſe, ſometimes he us'd one ſort, ſometimes another, providing Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits likewiſe ſorted to every kind of Diſguiſe, inſomuch as thoſe who but now departed from his Preſence, could not know him a moment after; nor could his moſt intimate Friends, without difficulty, diſtinguiſh him. And now <hi>Hannibal</hi> taking notice that the reſt of the <hi>Gauls</hi> were not very well ſatisfy'd that their Country ſhould continue to be the Seat of War, and that the Army was diſpos'd to follow him every-where, and impatiently deſir'd to march into the Enemy's Country, for the Hatred they pretended to the <hi>Romans</hi> (while in truth their thirſt of Booty was at the bottom) thought it time to move out of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61906:231"/>his Winter-Quarters, to gratifie the Deſire of the Army. Accordingly, as ſoon as the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favour'd his Deſign, and he had been throughly inſtructed in the way he propos'd to march, reſolving to ſhun the common Road, as being too long, and too well known to the Enemy; and concluding, that tho' the way through the low Fenny Country into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was the moſt difficult, yet being the ſhorteſt cut, and that <hi>Flaminius</hi> would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh'd at ſo hardy an Attempt; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (who was ever enclin'd to ſuch-like En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes) determin'd to take his paſſage that way. But it was no ſooner bruited in the Army, that the General had taken that Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, when every one ſhow'd his own ſhare of fear for ſo hazardous a March, through a Country lying for the moſt part under-water. and full of conceal'd Pits and Precipices.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after he had well inform'd himſelf of the Nature of the Soil through which he was to march, being now ſatisfy'd, that albeit the way was wet and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy, yet that it was hard at bottom, caus'd the Army to march. The Van he gave to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> and appointed the care of the Baggage to the beſt and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men in the Army, to the end that if they ſhould be oblig'd to encamp, they might have every thing at hand of which they cou'd ſtand in need: For in their other Marches, he took little or no care for the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61906:231"/>tranſporting of Proviſions along with him; taking for granted, That if they were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, they ſhould need none; and, That if they overcame and made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Country, where-ever they came all things would be provided for them. The <hi>Gauls</hi> march'd in the Rear of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> and the Horſe in the Rear of all. <hi>Hannibal</hi> order'd <hi>Mago</hi> to have a vigilant are to keep the Soldiers from ſtragling, and to march the Army in their order, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive leaſt the <hi>Gauls</hi> eſpecially, whoſe ſloth and impatience of Labour he very well knew, ſhould through the travail of ſo hard a march, be tempted to return back by the way they came; wherefore he Horſe were ſo poſted, that they might compel thoſe to march, who otherwiſe might be diſpos'd to deſert the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans</hi> then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vane'd into the Fens, where none before had ever adventur'd to go, and bore their part with chearfulneſs, they being a robuſt People, and harden'd to the like toilſome Exerciſes; but it far'd not ſo with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who march'd not but with great difficulty, for the Ground having been potch'd and broken by thoſe who march'd in the Van, they often ſell, and were not able to keep their Legs. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very difficult fort them to ſupport that kind of Travel, to which they bad never been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd, nor had they any hopes of remedy by returning back, the Horſe being poſted to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61906:232"/>hinder them. In a word; the whole Army ſuffer'd unſpeakable Hardſhips in this march, and what was moſt troubleſome, they were fore'd to paſs four Days and Nights without ſleep, marching conſtantly in Water; but to the <hi>Gauls</hi> it was moſt grievous, the greateſt part of their Horſe and other Beaſts were loſt by the way, falling and ſticking, in the Mud and Mire, which yet prov'd in ſome ſort a relief to the Soldiers; for lying with their Burthens in the way above Water, they paſs'd over them dry-ſhod, and often made uſe of them to repoſe on for ſome ſhort ſpace. The Hooſs of many of their Horſes that eſcap'd drop'd off through ſo long a Journey in the Water and Fenny Ground. <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf, who was earry'd by the only Elephant that was left, ſhar'd a ſevere part of the Hardſhip of the Journey; for being before much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a defluxion in his Eyes, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady grew to that height that he loſt one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely by the way, for want of time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place to attend his Cure.</p>
                     <p>After the Army (to the wonder of all the World) had paſs'd the Fens, <hi>Hannibal</hi> being inform'd that <hi>Flaminius</hi> was poſted near <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezzo,</hi> he led his Army as ſoon as poſſibly he could into the Upland Country, as well to refreſh and repoſe his Men, as to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Enemies Purpoſes, and of the courſe and ſituation of the Country. And after he had been told, that the Territory was rich,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61906:232"/>and that there was much Plunder to be got; that <hi>Flaminius</hi> was more an Orator than a Soldier; that tho' he had the Gift of Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he was totally to ſeek in Military Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and that furthermore, he was proud and grown confident of his numbers, and the ſtrength of his Army; he therefore conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if he could by any means march by him, and get into the Country beyond him, that this Conſul not able to ſuffer the Clamours and Reproaches of the Country-People, would be drawn to do his utmoſt to hinder him from ſpoiling and ravaging the Country; and that, in ſhort, he would be drawn into greater Aſſurance and Negligence, and endeavour to Attack the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at any rate, and follow them whitherſoever they ſhould lead him; and that impatient to ſhare the ſole Honour of the Victory, he would not be perſuaded to attend the coming of his Colleague. In ſhort, he collected by all theſe Circumſtances, that <hi>Flaminius</hi> was likely to afford him many occaſions to ſur-prize him, and lay Ambuſhes in his way to gall and moleſt him. And in truth he was not miſtaken in the judgment he had made of this Conſul. And moſt certain it is, that they think very wide of the Truth, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that to acquire a right Knowledge, and take juſt Meaſures of the Humour and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Enemy he is to deal with, is not among the prime Qualities and Duties of a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61906:233"/>General. For as not only when we fight Man to Man, but when one Rank chargeth another, he who thinks of Victory ought with exact care to obſerve, what naked or weak part the Enemy diſcovers, whereby to compaſs his End; in like manner, thoſe who have the Leading of Armies in time of War, ought with skill and addreſs to penetrate and diſcover the weak ſide of the Mind of that Captain with whom he hath to do. For there are thoſe, who by an unaccountable kind of Imbecility and a Thoughtfulneſs which infects all the Actions of Life, are not only remiſs in their Publick Adminiſtrations, but forget what belongs to the Duty of their Private Affairs.</p>
                     <p>Some are ſo abandon'd to the uſe of Wine, that neglecting Nature's invitations to repoſe, they become at length unable to ſleep, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by the Fumes of exceſſive Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; others are captivated by Love, who have not only thereby ſacrific'd the Safety of Cities and great States, but have themſelves paid down their own Lives with Infamy. Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, and a baſe Mind are Faults throughout the World, but moſt capital in a General; they are Blemiſhes to every private Man, where-ever they are found, and mark him with Reproach; but in the Leader of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they are a publick Curſe and Calamity. For, in ſhort, they are not only the cauſe of Armies languiſhing in Sloth and Idleneſs,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61906:233"/>without ever entring on Action; but they themſelves, who rely on ſuch Leaders, are often led into Precipices and inextricable Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Raſhneſs, Paſſion, Pride, and Vain-Glory, are all ſo many inlets to the Enemies Succeſs, leading Men as it were, and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Triumph of their Foes, and hurrying their Friends, and thoſe who truſt them, to Perdition: For ſuch Men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expos'd to the Trains and Stratagems of their Enemies. Wherefore he who wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudies and attains a right Knowledge of the Frailties and Weak-ſide of an Enemy, and Attacks him there, by vanquiſhing the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will ſoon be Maſter both of the General and his Army. For as a Veſſel that hath once loſt her Pilot, is not long able to diſpute it with an Enemy, and by taking him we ſoon become Maſters of all that was under his Charge; ſo in War, where the one General is ſuperior in Cunning or Military Abilities to the other, he ſhall alſo render his Army ſuperior to his Enemies. Thus, in a word, our wiſe <hi>African,</hi> having taken a ſcantling of the <hi>Roman</hi> General's Capacity, came at length to gain his Point.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Hannibal</hi> had decamp'd from about <hi>Feſulé,</hi> and had march'd by, and got ſome diſtance beyond the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, he ſell on their Frontiers; whereupon the Conſul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inrag'd to be thus contemn'd, as he conceiv'd. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> had no ſooner began
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61906:234"/>to ſpoil and ravage the Country, and the Smoke which appear'd every where from far, made it manifeſt that he was burning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all before him: <hi>Flaminius</hi> could not then abſtain from Tears. Nevertheleſs, when any undertook to adviſe, that it would be the ſafeſt courſe however not to follow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage temerariouſly with the Enemy, nor to come too haſtily, and without mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ration, to a Battel with an Army ſo much ſuperior to them in Horſe; and above all, that he ought to attend the coming of the other Conſul, and not adventure on Action till all their Troops were incorporated; he lent ſo deaf an Ear to theſe Counſels, that he had not Patience ſo much as to hear them; demanding of thoſe who thus advis'd him, What they thought the People of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſay of him, ſhould he permit the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to burn and deſtroy the Country with Fire and Sword up to the Walls of the City, while he remain'd in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> an idle Spectator of the Deſolation of his Country, and in the Rear of the Enemy, without attempting any thing? Wherefore he decamp'd, and caus'd the Army to march, and without regard to ſeaſon or ſituation, thought on nothing but how he might come ſpeedily to a Battel, as if Victory were the thing of all others he leaſt doubted. And, in a word, he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd the Army with ſo ſtrong an expectation of Succeſs, that there were ſee more Camp-Wenches,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61906:234"/>and the rake holly Equipage of Boys an Vagabonds following the Army, than there were Soldiers who bare Arms; and all this Rabble bringing with them Chains and Shackles to ſecure the Priſoners. In the mean time <hi>Hannibal</hi> led his Army through <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> on that Quarter that lies toward <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving the City of <hi>Corone</hi> and the neighbouring Mountains on his left-hand, and on his right the Lake <hi>Thraſimene;</hi> and, the more to provoke the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſack'd and deſtroy'd all the Towns that lay in his march, and did them all the other miſchiefs that are the product of the cruelleſt War. But as ſoon as he had notice of the approach of <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> and had made choice of Ground pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to put his Deſigns in execution, he reſolv'd to delay ſighting no longer.</p>
                     <p>The Ground he had choſen lay thus: There was a tract of plain even Ground, ſtretching out in length a good diſtance. This Level or Vale lay between, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd on both ſides with high Mountains, the farther end thereof being bounded by an inacceſſible Eminence, and the entrance bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd on a Lake, between which and the ſaid Mountain there is a very narrow Way or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file which leads into the Plain. <hi>Hannibal</hi> then having paſs'd into the Plain by that Streight, takes firſt poſſeſſion of the high Ground, he had in Front, where he lodg'd his <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans;</hi> behind the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61906:235"/>Mountains on the right, he poſted the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leares,</hi> and the reſt of his light-arm'd Troops, order'd in one deep File, and poſted the <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Horſe in the like order behind the Mountains on his left, in ſuch manner that they reach'd as far as the Defile we mention'd between the Lake and the Mountains, which is the Inlet to the Plain. Theſe Orders being executed in the Night, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> having thus ſurrounded the Plain, he remain'd quiet, making ſhow of a Deſire to ſit ſtill and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing. In the mean time, <hi>Flamini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> follows cloſe at his Rear, eagerly purſuing his Determination to attack him; and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Evening near the Lake <hi>Thraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,</hi> he there encamp'd, and early the next Morning march'd with his Van-guard along the Vale by the ſide of the Lake, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to fall on the Enemy. The Day prov'd very dark and lowring, by reaſon of a great Fogg that was riſen; nevertheleſs, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> upon notice that the better part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was now enter'd on the Plain, and that their Vanguard was hard at hand, gave the Signal of Battel, diſpatching his Orders to thoſe who were in ambuſh to do their Duty; ſo that the Enemy was on the ſudden ſurrounded, and at once attack'd on all ſides.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Flaminius</hi> and the whole Army with him, were ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at this ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſhock of the Enemy; for the Fogg was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61906:235"/>ſo thick, that they were not able to ſee about them; and the Enemy falling among them from the Hills in all Quarters at once, the Tribunes and Captains of the <hi>Romans</hi> could not diſcern which way to lead their Men, nor how to bring Succours and Relief where 'twas wanted, and were, in a word, totally to ſeek how to behave themſelves; for they were charg'd at one and the ſame time in Front, Flank, and Rear, by which means great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were ſlain, not as Men, ſighting like Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in Battel, but taken as it were by ſtealth in their march, e're they were able to put themſelves in a poſture of defence, being, as one may ſay, betray'd and enſnar'd by the Imprudence of their General. <hi>Flaminius</hi> himſelf, now deſtitute both of Hope and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, falling among a Party of <hi>Gauls,</hi> was by them environ'd and ſlain. In this Battel there fell, on the part of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the number of fifteen Thouſand; who were ſo beſet, that they could neither fight nor ſly; for it is religiouſly obſerv'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, never to abandon their Ranks, or break their Order by flight. Thoſe who were ſurpriz'd in the Paſſage between the Lake and the Mountain dy'd miſerably; for being puſh'd by the Enemy into the Lake, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd into the Water with their Arms, not having leiſure to think what they did, were unfortunately drown'd; others, being the greater part, enter'd the Lake, as far as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61906:236"/>they were able, leaving nothing above Water but their Heads, where they remain'd a while, till the Horſe coming in, attack'd them there: Whereupon ſeeing there was now no other Remedy, they demanded quarter in vain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all cut off, thoſe who were not ſlain by the Enemy killing one another. About ſix Thouſand, who were well advanc'd in the Plain, chanc'd to have the better of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whom they fought with in Front; but in regard they could not diſcover how the Battel went, they knew not whither to move, or whom to relieve, tho' it had been in their Power to have done much toward a Victory. Wherefore, believing they might light on ſome further occaſion of Action, they held on their march, advancing till they had gain'd the top of the Hills; where, after they had remain'd a while, and the Fogg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to clear up, beholding the lamentable ſtate of their Army, and it being now out of their power to perform any Service to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (the Enemy being Maſters of the Field) they made good their Retreat to a certain Town in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> But the Battel was no ſooner over, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſent a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and his light-arm'd Troops after them, under the Command of <hi>Maherbal,</hi> who beſieg'd them in the Place; and after he had reduc'd them to extremity, they yielded to his diſcretion, who gave them their Lives. Thus have we given the Narrative of this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61906:236"/>that was ſought in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians. Hannibal</hi> cauſing <hi>Maherbal</hi>'s Priſoners, to whom quarter had been given, to be brought before him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the reſt that had fallen into their hands, to the number of fifteen Thouſand: After he had told them, That it was by his Orders that <hi>Maherbal</hi> had given them their Lives, he diſtributed the <hi>Roman</hi> Priſoners to the Army, to ſecure them under a good Guard; but he ſent home all the <hi>Latins gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> telling them only, (what hath been elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where noted) That he was not come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade or moleſt the <hi>Italians,</hi> but to reſcue their Liberty out of the hands of the <hi>Romans.</hi> After this, he led his Army into Quarters of Refreſhment, and ſolemnly bury'd thirty of his Officers, who had been ſlain in the Battel: His other Loſſes were inconſiderable, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory not coſting him above fifteen Hundred Men, whereof the major part were <hi>Gauls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now his Hopes being thus juſtly rais'd, he deliberated with his Brother, and the reſt of his Friends, about the future Methods they were to take, for improving the Victories they had gain'd. In the mean time, when the news came to <hi>Rome</hi> of this Defeat, the Magiſtrates, who could neither ſoften nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh it, the Stroke had fallen ſo heavy, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the People, to whom they reported the naked truth of their Caſe. And when at the ſame time the Praetor, aſcending the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61906:237"/>pronounc'd theſe words, <hi>We are Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> they were ſtruck with ſuch terror, that thoſe who were then preſent, and had been in the Battel, thought they had cauſe to believe the Defeat was greater in <hi>Rome</hi> than in the Field. Nor indeed was this ſurprize without reaſon; for the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had held ſo long a poſſeſſion of Victory, and were to learn the mournful Language of Vanquiſh'd and Oppreſs'd, knew not how with Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſupport an Affliction ſo new and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. The Senate only preſerv'd their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with decency, and omitted nothing that belong'd to their Function, holding frequent Aſſemblies to deliberate about a Remedy for the Diſeaſe of which they were ſo ſick.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, who was at <hi>Rimini</hi> near <hi>Adria,</hi> on the Skirts of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> not far from the mouth of the <hi>Po,</hi> receiving intelligence that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was advanc'd into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and had beſieg'd <hi>Flaminius</hi> in his Camp, had therefore reſolv'd to march to his Relief, and joyn their Troops: But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his Army was too numerous to march all in one Body, he therefore pick'd out four Thouſand Horſe from the whole number of their Cavalry; and giving the Command of theſe to <hi>C. Centronius,</hi> order'd him to march before with expedition, in order to the relief of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> in caſe he ſhould chance to be preſs'd before he could arrive. But when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61906:237"/>
                        <hi>Hannibal</hi> got intelligence that they were now ſending thoſe Succours after the Battel was loſt, he order'd out <hi>Maherbal,</hi> with the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd Troops, and a Body of Horſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them. Accordingly they met with <hi>Centronius,</hi> fought with him, and beat him, killing almoſt half his Men on the place, and forcing the reſt to take Sanctuary on a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Hill, and the next Day they fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into their hands. It was but three Days ago that the news of their Misfortunes at the Battel of <hi>Thraſimene</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Sorrow in the utmoſt ferment, when, to fill up the meaſure of their Affliction, the news of this their laſt Defeat arrives; when behold now not only the People in conſternation, but the Senate it ſelf became ſenſibly touch'd. Whereupon they thought it needful, without deliberating on the Election of their Annual Magiſtrates, to reſolve on the choice of ſome one ſingle Perſon, in whom the ſole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould center. In the mean time, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> who by the ſucceſs of his Arms, grew to believe he ſhould be more than a Match for the <hi>Romans,</hi> did not think it convenient to approach preſently nearer <hi>Rome.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he continu'd to harraſs and ſpoil the Country, deſtroying all by Fire and Sword where-ever he came, taking his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Adria,</hi> where he arriv'd in ten Days, paſſing by the Frontiers of the <hi>Inſubrians</hi> and <hi>Picentines.</hi> The Country in his march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61906:238"/>rich, the Plunder of the Army grew ſo great and cumberſom, that they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry nor otherwiſe tranſport it. The People where-ever he came, he us'd with great Cruelty, and, according to the common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Treatment of Towns that are taken by force, order'd all to be ſlain that they could find of Age to bear Arms; ſuch merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs impreſſion had <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Hatred to the <hi>Romans</hi> given him.</p>
                     <p>Incamping now not far from <hi>Adria,</hi> in a pleaſant and fruitful Country, abounding in all things, he there gave order for the curing of his ſick and infirm Soldiers and Horſes; for in his Winter-Incampments, in the hither <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he lay expos'd to all the rigours of the open Air, incommoded by the ſtench of the filth and ordure of the Camp, that what by their unwholſome Incampments, what by their march through the Fens, both Men and Horſes (the whole Army over) were generally infected with a Diſeaſe call'd by the <hi>Greeks Lemopſoron;</hi> but with us, the <hi>Scurf</hi> or <hi>Scab,</hi> which comes by Unwholſome Diet and hard Uſage: Wherefore happening into this place, ſo commodious for every thing, he was willing they ſhould want for nothing that might advance their Recovery, renew the Strength, and recruit the Spirits of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being now poſſeſs'd of great quantities of <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, of thoſe he had either ſlain or taken, he therefore arm'd his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61906:238"/>
                        <hi>Africans</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner: He alſo diſpatch'd Letters by Sea to <hi>Carthage,</hi> giving an account of his Succeſſes, having never ſince his coming into <hi>Italy</hi> till now approach'd the Sea-Coaſt. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> receiv'd the News with great acclamations of Joy, and deliberated how beſt to re-inforce and ſupply their Armies both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> with all things of which they might ſtand in need.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> in the mean time, created <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> Dictator, a Perſon of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe, and of ſo exemplary Vertue, that his ſingle Merit acquir'd to his Family the Title of <hi>Maximi,</hi> from the great Actions he ſo happily WP2787atchiev'd. There is this difference among others betwixt a Dictator and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul; the Conſul hath but twelve Axes carried before him, the Dictator twenty four: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the Conſuls cannot act in many things without the Authority of the Senate; but the Power of the Dictator is abſolute and independent; and, during that Magiſtracy, the Authority of all others become ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that of the Tribunes of the People only excepted. But we ſhall treat more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly hereof in its proper place. After <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had been nam'd for Dictator, he choſe <hi>M. Minutius</hi> for his Maſter of the Horſe, which is a Charge depending intirely on the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſupplies his place in the Army when abſent.</p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:61906:239"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after he had refreſh'd his Army, mov'd by eaſie marches along the Coaſt of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> thereby to gain time till he had fill'd his Troops; here, by waſhing his Horſes with old Wine, whereof the Country abounded, he cur'd them of the Scratches and the Farcy. Neither did he omit any care for the cure and recovery of his wounded Men, by which means the reſt were hearten'd. and became the more chearfully diſpos'd to go on ſuch future hazardous Services, as he ſhould have further occaſion to uſe them in. Thus he continu'd his March, and after he had plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and forag'd the Territory of <hi>Pretutium, Adria,</hi> and that of the <hi>Marrucians,</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> he took his way towards <hi>Apulia,</hi> which is diſtinguiſh'd by three Diviſions, each having its peculiar name. One part is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the <hi>Daunians,</hi> and another by the <hi>Meſſapians. Hannibal</hi> firſt attack'd the <hi>Daunians,</hi> and made ſpoil about <hi>Luceria,</hi> a Colony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he put all to Fire and Sword. Then he encamp'd near <hi>Ibona,</hi> from whence he ſent his Troops to ravage the Lands of the <hi>Arpians;</hi> and, in ſhort, over-ran the whole Country of <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this time <hi>Fabius</hi> enter'd on his Charge, who, after he had ſacrific'd to the Gods, march'd out of the City with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe, at the head of four new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais'd Legions, which had been ſevied accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61906:239"/>to Cuſtom. And, after he had joyn'd his Troops near the Frontiers of the <hi>Dannians,</hi> with thoſe that had been ſent to <hi>Rimini,</hi> he ſent the Conſul back to <hi>Rome,</hi> with Orders to Command the Fleet, and have an Eye to the Enemies Motions by Sea; while himſelf and the General of the Horſe, after he had taken poſſeſſion of the Legions, march'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd near <hi>Aegas,</hi> in view of the Enemy, and not above ſix Miles from their Camp.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> as ſoon as he had notice of the arrival of <hi>Fabius,</hi> led his Army out of the Camp, and marching, drew them up in Battalia near the <hi>Romans,</hi> to amuſe and terrifie them: Where having remain'd ſome time, and none appearing to oppoſe him, he march'd back to his Quarters. For <hi>Fabius,</hi> who had determin'd to do nothing raſhly, and not to come preſently to a Battel, but to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by all Arts and Means to ſecure the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his Country, held firm to his firſt Reſolution. By which means he ſoon grew into Contempt, was reckon'd a Coward by his Country-men, and one who out of poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit ſhun'd all occaſions of having to do with the Enemy. But in the end his Actions taught them better how to value him; and to confeſs, That they could never have choſen a Leader, who better knew his Buſineſs, or could proceed with more Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good Conduct, which ſhortly after, the iſſue of his Adminiſtiation abundantly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61906:240"/>manifeſted. <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Troops who had been bred and broken to their Trade from their Childhood, and he himſelf brought up among them, and a perfect Maſter in Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knowledge, who had fought many Battels with Succeſs in <hi>Spain,</hi> and gain'd two impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Victories already againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allies: And what out-weigh'd all we have ſaid, and which to him was of greateſt importance, was that his Troops had no hopes or proſpect of Safety, but what they carry'd on the Points of their Swords; which was <hi>Fabius</hi>'s Motive to work with ſo much Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Circumſpection, being well aſſur'd the Enemy would be ſuperiour to him in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. Wherefore, by ſingular Prudence and Addreſs, he had recourſe only to thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, wherein he was ſure the <hi>Romans</hi> were the ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>In a word, the Benefits the <hi>Romans</hi> enjoy'd, and of which the Enemy could not deprive them, were Proviſions of Victuals, and Stores of War in great abundance, and plenty of good Men to recruit their Armies. <hi>Fabius</hi> therefore held on his March in the Enemies Rear, and kept always near him, ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping on proper Ground for his purpoſe, which he very well knew how to chuſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a perfect knowledge of the Country: And being ſupply'd from the places behind him with what he ſtood in need of, he never adventur'd his Soldiers abroad to Forrage,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61906:240"/>nor permitted them ſo much as to be ſeen out of the Camp. Wherefore being enclos'd continually within their Ramparts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually on the watch to ſpy any advantage, by the means he ſurpriz'd and cut off great numbers of the Enemy, who chane'd to ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle any diſtance from their Camp, or who, out of contempt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> forrag'd near them. By this means he diminiſh'd his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies numbers, and bred Courage and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in his own Soldiers; and by theſe little Combats and Rencounters, taught them to recover their Spirits, which were much ſunk by their late Calamities, whereby thoſe who had been hitherto vanquiſh'd, might begin not to deſpair of Victory. But nothing could draw him to come to a pitch'd Field. While, on the other hand, <hi>Minutius,</hi> his Maſter of the Horſe, was neither of his Judgment nor Humor. For he leaning conſtantly to the Opinion of the Multitude, made a little too bold with the Dictator in his Diſcourſe, repreſenting him as a flow and baſhful Man, while he, for his part, was of another Temper, ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize any thing, and willing to come ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to a Battel. After the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had waſted the Country round about, as we but now mention'd, they paſs'd the <hi>Apennines,</hi> and enter'd into the Territory of the <hi>Sannites,</hi> a fertile Soil, and where for a long time they had felt nothing of the deſolations of War.</p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61906:241"/>
                     <p>Here they met with ſuch abundance of all things, that it was not poſſible for them to conſume the ſtore, either by their Expence or their Malice. They plunder'd likewiſe the Lands of the <hi>Beneventines,</hi> where there was a Colony of <hi>Romans,</hi> and took the City of <hi>Venoſa,</hi> albeit a ſtrong Town and furniſh'd for defence. In the mean time the <hi>Romans</hi> follow'd their ſteps, keeping within a Days march or two at moſt of them, but approach'd not nearer, being in no wiſe diſpos'd to come to a Battel. Whereupon, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> found that <hi>Fabius</hi> would not be perſuaded to fight, he reſolv'd to take his march towards <hi>Falernum,</hi> a Town in the Territory of <hi>Capua;</hi> concluding that one of theſe two things would thereby be brought to paſs; namely, that either he ſhould compel the Enemy to give him Battel; or, in caſe of refuſal, it would be made manifeſt to all the World he was their ſuperior, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reſolution to come to a Deciſion. And by this means he reckon'd that the Towns and Cities would be terrify'd into ſubmiſſion, and to abandon the <hi>Romans.</hi> For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s two Victories, there was not yet one <hi>Italian</hi> Town that had taken part with him, but preſerv'd their Faith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the <hi>Romans,</hi> tho' ſome were hard preſs'd and ſtreighten'd by the Enemy; from whence may be gather'd what deference and veneration they had for the <hi>Roman</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61906:241"/>Nor did <hi>Hannibal</hi> take this Reſolution raſhly, and without ripe Deliberation; for the Champaign Country about <hi>Capua</hi> is the beſt part of the richeſt and moſt beautiful Soil in the World. Furthermore, it borders on the Sea by which <hi>Italy</hi> holds intercourſe with all Foreign Countries. Over and above theſe Incouragements, the nobleſt and moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Towns of all <hi>Italy</hi> are found here; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (on the Sea-Coaſt) <hi>Sinueſſa, Cuma, Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zola, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Nuceria:</hi> On the Frontiers, towards the Weſt, <hi>Calenum</hi> and <hi>Theano;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South-Eaſt, <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Nola. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi> is ſituate in the heart of the Country, and ſurpaſs'd heretofore in Riches and Luxury all other Cities; ſo much like the Truth are the Fables that are recorded of this delicious Territory, known likewiſe by the name of the <hi>Phlegraean</hi>-Fields, with thoſe ſam'd in <hi>Greece</hi> for their Beauty and Amoenity. In ſhort, it may be ſaid, That it was principally for this happy Country, that the Gods once contended. Furthermore, this Country is fortify'd by Nature, and the Acceſſes to it difficult: For on the one hand it is defended by the Sea, and on the other by a Chain of continu'd Mountains. In a word, there are but three Avenues to it, and theſe very ſtreight and difficult over the ſaid Mountains. The firſt is that which leads to <hi>Samnium;</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to <hi>Eribanus;</hi> and the third from the Country of the <hi>Hirpins.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61906:242"/>was not without hopes, that if he could compaſs the Conqueſt of this part of <hi>Italy,</hi> he ſhould be able from thence to awe all the World beſide, and bring a Contempt on his fluggiſh Enemy, who had not the Courage to forbid him; and that no body would then doubt, but he was in effect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all without the <hi>Roman</hi> Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal</hi> wrought on by theſe Reaſons, having left <hi>Samnium,</hi> and gain'd his paſſage by the way of the Mountain call'd <hi>Eribanus,</hi> he encamp'd on the Banks of the River <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurnus,</hi> which divides and runs through that part of <hi>Campania</hi> that regards <hi>Italy;</hi> and from hence forag'd and made Devaſtations in the Country round about, none appearing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach him, while <hi>Fabius,</hi> tho' wondring at the temerity of his Project, held the faſter to his firſt Determination. But <hi>Minutius,</hi> on the contrary, and the reſt of the prime Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, perſuaded they had now coop'd-up the Enemy, became very inſtant that they might haſten their march into <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania;</hi> and that it was not to be ſupported, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhould, without controul, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and deſtroy the beſt and moſt flouriſhing part of <hi>Italy.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Fabius</hi> made ſhow of being reaſon'd into their Opinion, and feign'd to be as forward to find out the Enemy and give him Battel as they were, till he had got into the Country, whither he march'd
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61906:242"/>the Army with great expedition. But when he drew near the Territory of the <hi>Falernians,</hi> he contented himſelf with barely making an appearance with his Army along the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and to keep pace with the Enemy, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt their Allies ſhould think that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> out of dread of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, confin'd themſelves entirely to their Camp. Nevertheleſs, he adventur'd not into the plain Country, but continu'd to ſhun all occaſions of coming to a Battel, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons already render'd, and for that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> much out-number'd them in Horſe. Wherefore, after <hi>Hannibal</hi> had challeng'd the <hi>Romans</hi> by all ſorts of Provocations and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, plunder'd all <hi>Campania,</hi> and amaſs'd a mighty Booty, he began to conſult about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping, reſolving by no means to part with his Spoil, but to convey it to ſome faſe place, where he ſhould keep his Winter-Quarters; to the end his Army might not only have a preſent enjoyment of the fruit of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but a proſpect of plenty of every good thing for the time to come. <hi>Fabius</hi> then col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, that the Enemy had a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by the way he came, concluded to way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay him by an Ambuſh in the Deſile or Paſs over the Mountains. He therefore order'd a Detachment of four Thouſand Men, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and take poſſeſſion of the ſaid Paſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to make good uſe of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlion, and the advantage of the Poſt, when
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61906:243"/>they came to the Engagement, which they ſo earneſtly and ſo long deſired to ſee. This done, he march'd himſelf with the Groſs of the Army, and poſſeſs'd the Mountains that commanded the ſaid Paſſage by which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was to march.</p>
                     <p>And now the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> advancing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd at the foot of the Mountains, while <hi>Fabius</hi> was not in hopes only of making them part with their Plunder; but that if Fortune prov'd never ſo little his Friend, to be able at one ſtroke to put a period to the War. Thus favour'd as he was by the advantage of the Ground, <hi>Fabius</hi> then had nothing ſo much in his Thoughts, as how beſt to poſt and deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his Troops; to lay his Ambuſh with moſt advantage; whom principally to make choice of for their ſeveral Parts they were to execute, and where firſt to begin the Attack. But while he thus ſtood deliberating, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the execution to the next Morning, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> who had got intelligence of his Deſign, gave him not time to put it in effect. Firſt then, he gave his Orders to <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> (who had the general charge of the Pioneers and Workmen of the Army) to provide as many Faggots of dry combuſtible Matter as he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could procure; to make choice of two Thouſand of the beſt and ſtrongeſt Oxen, as could be pick'd out of the whole Herd of Plunder, and to bring them to a certain place near the Camp, there to attend his further
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:61906:243"/>Commands. This done, he caus'd the Grooms and Rabble of the Army to be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and pointing to them a piece of Ground at a diſtance, that lay between the Camp and the Paſs by which he was to march, order'd them, That as ſoon as they ſhould receive the Signal that ſhould be given, to drive and force the ſaid Herd of Cattel by that way up to the top of the Mountains. This done, he bad the Army to take their Supper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their repoſe; and about the third Watch of the Night, he commanded the ſaid Rabble to bind and faſten the Faggots they had provided, to the Horns of the two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Oxen. This being ſoon done, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great number of Hands that were employ'd, he then ordering the Faggots to be lighted, gave them the Signal to march, and drive them up as he had appointed. He order'd likewiſe his light-arm'd Troops to march in the Rear of theſe, and a while to encourage and ſuſtain them; but that as ſoon as the Cattel began to run and diſperſe, they ſhould with ſhoutings and great clamour take poſſeſſion of all the advantageous Poſts, and gain the top of the Mountains, to the end thereby to cover and defend the Army in their paſſage through the Defile, and amuſe and divert the Enemy, in caſe they found them there. In the mean time <hi>Hannibal</hi> decamps, leading his Army towards the Streight by which they were to march. The Van-guard
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61906:244"/>conſiſted of his heavy-arm'd Troops; theſe were follow'd by the Horſe; after them went the Baggage and Booty, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> in the Rear of all.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> who had been poſted at the entry of the Paſs, beholding ſo many Fires wandring about the Mountains, took it for granted, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had taken his March that way: Whereupon quitting their Poſts in the Streight, they march'd with expedition up the Mountains; but when they arriv'd, and ſaw nothing but the Cattel carrying Fire on their Heads, they grew greatly aſtoniſh'd, and were ſtruck with greater apprehenſion of Danger than they needed. But now behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hannibal</hi> on his March, who had already gain'd the Paſs, they made ſome ſmall attempt upon them; but the Cattel carrying Fire on their Heads, covering the Mountain, and mingling every-where among them, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted them, that they concluded it to be their ſafeſt courſe to keep the tops of the Hills, and remain there on their guard till Morning, when they might be better able to diſcern what it was that had ſo perplex'd them.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Fabius</hi> was in trouble to underſtand the myſtery of ſo many Fires, and began to ſuſpect it to be no other than what it really was, namely, a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Stratagem. Nevertheleſs, mindful of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution he had taken to hazard nothing, he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61906:244"/>kept his Army within their Works, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to ſtir till Morning; while <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> obſerving that his Project ſucceeded to his wiſh, and that the Defile remain'd totally unguarded, paſs'd ſafely with his Army and his Plunder. But early in the Morning, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the Party which had advanc'd to the tops of the Mountains, were in danger, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had march'd thither in the Night, out-numbring them; he therefore ſent a Party of <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſuſtain and bring them off; who, falling on the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſlew about a Thouſand of them, and with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty made good their Companions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal</hi> having now gain'd his paſſage out of the Territory of <hi>Falernum,</hi> and ſeeing himſelf in ſafety, began to conſider upon Winter-Quarters, and deliberated thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Friends: For he had now ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd <hi>Italy</hi> throughout all Quarters, that the whole Country ſtood aſtoniſh'd and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd what Counſels to take; inſomuch, that <hi>Fabius</hi> was held in great Contempt, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, through want of Reſolution, permitted the Enemy to make his eſcape, when he had enclos'd him in places of ſo great advantage; yet all could not move him a jot to depart from the Methods he had propos'd to purſue, contemning all thoſe vain Reports, and the Opinion which the People had conceiv'd of him.</p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:61906:245"/>
                     <p>Sometime after <hi>Fabius</hi> being call'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> to officiate at their Sacrifices, he committed the Legions to the Conduct of <hi>Minutius,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning him above all things at his departure, to have a more vigilant Eye to the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Army, than how to Attack the Enemy. But <hi>Minutius</hi> was ſo deaf to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that even while <hi>Fabius</hi> was urging thoſe ſafe Counſels, he was meditating how by all means poſſible he might bring it about to give the Enemy Battel. This was the poſture of Affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> while <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> at the head of an Army in <hi>Spain,</hi> having equipp'd a Fleet of thirty Veſſels (during the Winter) which had been left him by his Brother, and adding to them ten more, with all their Equipage that had been ſent him from other parts, he departed in the beginning of Summer from <hi>New-Carthage;</hi> his Fleet, conſiſting of forty Ships, he committed to the care of <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> with Orders to coaſt it along the Shore, while he with his Land-Army march'd at the ſame time, keeping near the Sea, with intention to joyn both Armies near the mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Eber. Cn. Scipio</hi> coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> purpoſe, determin'd forthwith to march out of his Winter-quarters, and endeavour to get before them. But, after he had been inform'd of their great Strength, both in numbers of Men, and all ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of War, he declin'd his Purpoſe of dealing with them by Land, and equipp'd a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61906:245"/>Naval Army, conſiſting of five and thirty Ships, and putting on Board the beſt Men of the Land-Army, made Sail and got before the Enemy. Two Days after his departure from <hi>Tarragona</hi> he arriv'd near the mouth of the <hi>Eber,</hi> and about ten Miles from the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Fleet; from whence he diſpatch'd two Scout-Veſſels of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> to diſcover the Motions and Intentions of the Enemy; theſe Veſſels were the foremoſt in all Dangers, and kept always a head of the Fleet, with a forwardneſs that prov'd very uſeful to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> For the <hi>Marſeillians</hi> had always ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken part with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and eſpous'd their Cauſe more conſpicuouſly in this Adventure. The Scouts that had been ſent out brought advice, that the Enemies Fleet was at an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the mouth of the <hi>Eber:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Scipio</hi> forthwith got under Sail, reſolving to make the beſt of his way to ſurprize them, as they lay.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> receiving timely notice of the Enemies approach by certain Beacons that he order'd to be provided on the Hills, put his Land-Forces in order of Battel on the Shore, and order'd the Marine Army forthwith to imbark. As the <hi>Romans</hi> drew near the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they caus'd their Trumpets to ſound, and came to Blows with them out of hand. But the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> after they had ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly diſputed the Victory for a while, at length began to retire. But their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61906:246"/>that was drawn up on the Shore, prov'd as it fortun'd rather a Miſchief than a Benefit, by how much their preſence ſo near at hand gave the Sea-men a more certain proſpect of Safety by ſlight, than by fighting; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, perceiving the <hi>Romans</hi> likely to prove ſuperior to them, they ſtood about and fled as faſt as they could toward the Shore, after they had ſuſtain'd the loſs both of Men and Gallies. But the <hi>Romans</hi> vigorouſly purſuing the Advantage, forc'd them at laſt quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, where deſerting their Veſſels, they ſav'd themſelves by eſcaping to their Land-Forces that were drawn up hard by; the <hi>Romans</hi> following them to the Shore, and taking as many of their Veſſels as they could carry off, well-pleas'd to have beaten the Enemy at their firſt eſſay, taking thirty five of their Veſſels, and making themſelves Maſters of thoſe Seas. After this Victory the Affairs of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> began to have a better face in thoſe Parts.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intelligence of this loſs, fitted out a Fleet with all Expedition, conſiſting of ſeventy Sail equipp'd for War, well knowing of what moment it was to them to preſerve their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea. This Fleet firſt touch'd in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and then call'd at <hi>Piſa</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> hoping they might have found <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to have conſulted and concerted Matters with him. But the <hi>Romans</hi> coming after them
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61906:246"/>with a Fleet of an hundred and twenty Sail of Gallies, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> terrify'd with their numbers return'd directly back to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Carthage. Cn. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius,</hi> General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet, made chace after them for a while, in hopes of coming to an Ingagement, but finding they had got too much the ſtart of him, he left off the purſuit. Then he made Sail for <hi>Lilybae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> with the whole Fleet; from thence he ſteer'd his courſe to a certain Iſland in the <hi>African</hi> Sea call'd <hi>Cercina,</hi> where he levy'd Money on the Inhabitants, to purchaſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of their Country from Plunder. From thence he held on his way and came to an Iſland call'd <hi>Coſſyrus,</hi> which he took, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had put a Garriſon into the Town, he return'd back to <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> where, leaving the Fleet in Harbour he went himſelf to find out their Land-Forces.</p>
                     <p>The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> receiving Intelligence of <hi>Scipio's</hi> Sea-Victory, concluded that it was not only convenient, but neceſſary to the Common-wealth, that they ſhould not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Aſſairs in <hi>Spain;</hi> wherefore to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the War on that ſide, and preſs the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> the more in theſe Parts, they ſitted out a Squadron of twenty Gallies, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with gave them into the Charge of <hi>Pub. Scipio,</hi> diſpatching him to his Brother, to the end they might jointly manage the War in <hi>Spain.</hi> For the Senate juſtly apprehended, that if
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61906:247"/>the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſhould once be permitted to conquer and poſſeſs at their pleaſure that. Province, they would ſoon recover their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea, attack and make Deſcents in <hi>Italy</hi> with eaſe, and be enabled to re-inforce and ſupply <hi>Hannibal</hi> both with Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Wherefore, I ſay, the <hi>Romans,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that keeping the War on foot in <hi>Spain</hi> was of great utility to their Aſſairs, diſpatch'd <hi>Pub. Scipio</hi> with a Naval Army to joyn his Brother; who, after his Arrival, when they came to unite their Strength, proceeded with great Succeſs. For albeit the <hi>Romans</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet attempted to paſs the <hi>Eber,</hi> but thought it a great deal for them, that the People on this ſide the River were diſpos'd to enter into Friendſhip and Confederacy with them; yet now they adventur'd to paſs thoſe Bounds, making War on remoter Nations, and Fortune approv'd their Enterprize: For, after they had terrify'd the People that inhabit on the Banks of the <hi>Eber,</hi> they advanc'd toward <hi>Saguntum,</hi> and encamp'd within five Miles thereof, in the neighbourhood of the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſo poſted themſelves, that they were every way cover'd from Attempts of an Enemy, and where whatever they wanted might with caſe be ſupply'd them, for their Fleet by Sea kept pace with them on Land, coaſting it along the Shore at the ſame rate they march'd.</p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:61906:247"/>
                     <p>But in the mean time there happen'd an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence which avail'd further toward the Proſperity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Aſſairs. Upon <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s departure on his Expedition to <hi>Italy,</hi> he took Hoſtages of all the Towns of whoſe Affection he was not well aſſur'd; making choice for that purpoſe of the Children of the principal Inhabitants, and ſending them to be carefully kept under a good Guard at <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> that place being not only well fortify'd, but the Garriſon he had left in it well diſpos'd to his Service. Among thoſe there was one <hi>Abilyx</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a Man of the firſt Rank in his Country, both for his Authority and Manners; and, above all, reckon'd among the moſt faithful Friends of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> This Man, taking the preſent poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs into Conſideration, and obſerving the <hi>Romans</hi> likely to proſper, took a Reſolution worthy of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> which was to bring it about that the ſaid Hoſtages might be deliver'd up, believing that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing ſome remarkable Service to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> he ſhould become very Popular, and be well receiv'd among them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> had committed the Government of that Province to <hi>Boſtar,</hi> a Man of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> with Orders to oppoſe the <hi>Romans,</hi> when at any time they ſhould attempt paſſing the River <hi>Eber;</hi> but he, wanting Reſolution to withſtand them, had retir'd from his Poſt, and march'd and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61906:248"/>encamp'd near <hi>Saguntum</hi> towards the Sea. Now <hi>Abilyx</hi> well knew, that <hi>Boſtar</hi> was a plain well meaning Man, of eaſie Faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practis'd in ſubtile Arts, and had a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him: He therefore imparts to him what he ſeign'd was the beſt Counſel he could take; namely, that ſince the <hi>Romans</hi> had now gain'd their paſſage over the River, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> would be no longer able to hold the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in ſubjection by fear; but that it imported them, in the preſent evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of their Aſſairs, to acquire by ſome extraordinary means the Affection and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of the Natives: That the <hi>Romans</hi> were already under the Walls of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> which was in a manner beſieg'd, and would be ſoon ſtreightned: That therefore if he would give a check to their Ambition and Succeſs, he could not take a wifer or more ſafe courſe, than preſently to reſolve on the reſtoring all the Hoſtages to their Parents and Relations: For that the Enemy coveted nothing with more paſſion, than to be able to get them into their hands; to the end, that by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them up, they might acquire and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate thereby the good Opinion of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi> That, in a word, it would be an act of great Wiſdom in him to obviate this Inconvenience, by reſtoring the Hoſtages himſelf, which would bind the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to him for ever; and that he, for his part, would labour his utmoſt, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61906:248"/>might reap the beſt fruit of ſo fair a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they ſhould think ſit to commit the Conduct thereof to his management: For if it were tranſacted by him, he ſhould be both able and willing to negotiate the Affair, with ſuch regard to the Intereſt of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in the reſpective Towns concern'd, that their Relations ſhould not only be made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Benefit, but the People in general diſpos'd to acknowledge their Good-will, when they beheld ſuch remarkable Inſtances of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Friendſhip. He likewiſe gave <hi>Boſtar</hi> himſelf hopes of a valuable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, from thoſe whoſe Children ſhould be ſo deliver'd; and that, in ſhort, by his reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in ſo generous a manner, and contrary to all expectation, what was ſo dear to them, every one would emulate the other in their Expreſſions of Gratitude to ſuch a Benefactor. In a word, he dealt with <hi>Boſtar</hi> by all the fair Arguments he was able to urge, to win him over to his purpoſe. After this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, matters being concluded between them, and a Day ſet when he ſhould return with all neceſſary Preparations to receive and conduct the Hoſtages, <hi>Abilyx</hi> return'd home. The following Night he went to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, where after ſome Diſcourſe with certain <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> that ſerv'd in the Army, he was by them conducted to the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s; to whom he made it appear by many Reaſons, That the whole Body of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would come in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61906:249"/>to them, were it but once known that their Hoſtages were in their Poſſeſſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gave them his Word to deliver them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands. <hi>Publius</hi> liſt'ned with great pleaſure to the Propoſition; and after ſolemn promiſe of a noble Recompence, and the time when, and the place where they ſhould attend to execute the Deſign, agreed on, he diſmiſs'd them, who return'd back to <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> And now <hi>Abilyx,</hi> having provided Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons proper for his Enterprize, came to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar;</hi> and after the Hoſtages were put into his hands, he departed by Night from <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> as feigning thereby to be able to go more conceal'd from the Enemy's Sentinels. But having paſs'd their Camp, he then took another way, and led them at the time agreed on, to the place appointed, where he deliver'd them to thoſe who had been order'd to take charge of them. This was ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Abilyx</hi>'s Good-will to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Scipio</hi> held him ever after in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, making uſe of him in conjunction with People of his own, to ſee the Hoſtages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to their Parents and their Country: who went accordingly from Town to Town; where he negotiated ſo well for the <hi>Romans,</hi> giving the People ſuch Impreſſions of their Generoſity and Humanity, and declaiming ſo juſtly againſt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Cruelty and Inſidelity, and producing himſelf as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of deſerting them, that he wrought
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61906:249"/>many Towns over to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into Confederacy with them. <hi>Boſtar,</hi> who had committed theſe Children to the Faith of <hi>Abilyx,</hi> acted a very Child's Part himſelf, and not like an Officer of his Age and Experience, becoming afterwards there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by liable to many and great Dangers. But foraſmuch as the Seaſon of the Year forbad any further preſent action, they withdrew on both ſides into Winter-Quarters. Afterwards the <hi>Romans</hi> (Fortune changing in favour of their Affairs) receiv'd manifold Advantages by means of the Hoſtages they had ſo given up, being thereby greatly aſſiſted in their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Enterprizes. Thus have we deliver'd a ſtate of the Occurrences in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to return to our Hiſtory of <hi>Hannibal:</hi> He receiving intelligence by his Spies, That there was much Corn at <hi>Luceria</hi> and <hi>Geruni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and that <hi>Gerunium</hi> was a commodious place wherein to make his Magazines; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſolv'd to make that Country his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quarters, and ſo lead his Army by the way of the Mountains of <hi>Liburnum,</hi> to the ſaid Towns. When he arriv'd at <hi>Gerunium,</hi> which ſtands about twenty five Miles from <hi>Luceria,</hi> he ſought by all fair Means and large Promiſes, to win them to take part with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> offering to bind himſelf by Oath to the punctual execution of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that ſhould be accorded to. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not ſo prevail, he ſat down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61906:250"/>the Town; and laying ſiege to it ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

From thence he ſent two third parts of his Army to gather in Corn, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by turns to ſupply daily the other third part that remain'd with him, with a certain quantity for their Expence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing with them conſtantly in Battalia, as well for the guard of the Camp, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſudden attempt on thoſe who were employ'd in gathering in the Corn. In ſhort, the Country being very fertile, and the time of Harveſt at the heighth, they daily brought in very great quantities.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Minutius</hi> had receiv'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Army from <hi>Fabius,</hi> as we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he loſt no time, but march'd by the tops of the Mountains to find out the Enemy, hoping for an occaſion to deal with <hi>Hannibal</hi> there. But when he came to underſtand, That he was already Maſter of <hi>Gerunium;</hi> that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were ſpread all over the Country gathering in Corn, and that the Army was encamp'd under the Walls of the Town, he forthwith deſcended from the Hills into the Champaign Country, and encamp'd in the Territory of <hi>Larinam,</hi> on a high Ground call'd <hi>Calela,</hi> with a full determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61906:250"/>to do his utmoſt to come by any means ſpeedily to a Battel. <hi>Hannibal</hi> having notice of the approach of the <hi>Romans,</hi> permitted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one part of his Army to purſue their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt-work, while he with the other two thirds advanc'd toward the Enemy, poſting himſelf on an Eminence about two Miles diſtant from <hi>Gerunium,</hi> to try if he could from thence awe them, and alſo to be in a better Poſt to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour his Foragers, in caſe they ſhould chance to be preſs'd. But there happening to be a piece of high Ground between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which commanded near the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, he ſent thither in the Night two Thouſand of his light-arm'd Troops to take poſſeſſion thereof. This being obſerv'd in the Morning by <hi>Minutius,</hi> he immediately order'd out his light-arm'd Soldiers likewiſe againſt them, who attack'd them in their Poſt. The Diſpute was very warm for a while; but in the end the <hi>Romans</hi> prevail'd; and diſlodging the Enemy, came and poſted themſelves there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal</hi> after this, remain'd quiet in his Camp for ſome Days with all his Troops, for that they had the <hi>Romans</hi> now ſo near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but after a while he was neceſſitated to ſend abroad for Forage for his Horſe, and to fetch in Corn for the ſupply of his Camp; for that he was unwilling not only to ſpend out of the Store they had laid up, but ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to add to what they had already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61906:251"/>to the end they might live in plenty during Winter, both Horſe and Man, placing his greateſt hopes of ſucceſs in the Service of his Horſe.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Minutius,</hi> being inform'd that the Enemy was abroad in great numbers, diſpers'd here and there about the Country, for the Services above-mention'd, order'd his Troops to march at an Hour he thought moſt proper; and, being not far from the Enemies Camp, drew up his Army in Battalia, and ordering his Horſe and light-arm'd Troops to be drawn up in Parties and ſmall Diviſions, commanded them to march and attack the Foragers, and to give no Quarter. This Action did not a little perplex <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had not then Strength enough at hand to make head againſt the Enemy, nor to ſuccour thoſe who were ſcatter'd ſtragling about the Country.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out againſt the Foragers, kill'd many as they found them wand'ring to and again; and thoſe, who ſtood drawn up in Battalia, began ſo to contemn the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that not ſatisfy'd to confine them to their Camp, they were hardly with-held from attempting their Works; inſomuch that <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſeem'd to be greatly ſtreight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed: Yet albeit he was reduc'd to that extremity, that it was all he could do to keep his Ground and defend the Camp, yet he deſerted not his Poſt. In ſhort,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61906:251"/>
                        <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> receiving thoſe into the Camp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Walls of <hi>Gerunium,</hi> that had eſcap'd thither from the Enemy, march'd at the head of four Thouſand Men to the relief of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who, being now in ſome ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſorc'd, advanc'd againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſtood ſome time in Battalia, not far diſtant from their Camp, ſo that in the end he came fairly off of the Danger that threaten'd him, tho' with difficulty enough; but, in a word, he came off. <hi>Minutius</hi> having ſlain many of the Enemy in this Rencounter, and more of the Foragers, retir'd to his Camp full of aſſurance of future Succeſs; and on the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, upon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> marching out of their Works, he follow'd them and took poſſeſſion of their Camp: For <hi>Hannibal</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould by ſurprize in the Night attempt and aſſault his Camp at <hi>Geru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> which was not in a very good ſtate of Defence, and might thereby become Maſters of their Baggage, their Plunder, and all the Stores they had there laid up, was therefore determin'd to return and abide in thoſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In the mean time the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> forag'd for the furture with more caution, and the <hi>Romans</hi> manifeſted leſs apprehenſion of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The news of this Action being brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and publiſh'd with more Vanity than Truth, there was great Joy in the City. For, after the Conſternation they had been in,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61906:252"/>they reckon'd it a Change greatly for the better, and as an Omen of their future good Fortune; and, that if their Armies had not of a long time perform'd any thing to the purpoſe, it was not at leaſt through the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice of the Soldiers, but the puſillanimity of the Dictator, who apprehended every thing. So that all the World began now to reproach <hi>Fabius,</hi> and blame his Conduct, for having loſt ſo many fair occaſions plainly through want of Reſolution. But they heap'd ſo many Praiſes on <hi>Minutius,</hi> that in the end they decreed him an Honour that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any example in the Republick. For they inveſted him with abſolute Authority; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that by that act, they ſhould put it in his Power to give a ſpeedy Period to the War; and now by this Decree they came to have two Dictators at one and the ſame time to Conduct their Affairs, which never happen'd at any time before among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> When <hi>Minutius</hi> came to underſtand how highly he was exalted in the Opinion of the People, and that they had given him full Power, he grew more determin'd and forward to attempt every thing how hazardous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Fabius</hi> returns to the Army, without any change of Judgment through the Injuries which had been done him; but rather more confirm'd in the Rules he had laid down to himſelf; and obſerving
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61906:252"/>that <hi>Minutius</hi> was now become inſolent, and uneaſie to him, by his new Authority and Succeſſes, and that he oppos'd him in every thing through a kind of Jealouſie he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and that he was likely to puſh Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to a deciſive Battel, he therefore put it to his choice whether they ſhould command the Army by Days alternately, or divide the Army and command the diſtinct Bodies apart, and have two ſeparate Camps, and act as each of them ſaw good? <hi>Minutius</hi> thereupon inclin'd to divide the Army, whereupon the Legions were divided, and encamp'd a-part, about a Mile and an half aſunder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as well by the Priſoners he had taken, as by their Proceedings, had now learn'd there was an ill underſtanding between the two Generals, and well knew too the Mind of <hi>Minutius;</hi> wherefore rightly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this poſture of their Affairs would in the end work more Miſchief to them than to him, he began to contrive how to lay Baits for <hi>Minutius,</hi> that he might a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain his Inſolence and confound his Deſigns. And obſerving a ſmall riſing Ground between his and <hi>Minutius</hi>'s Camp, by which either might incommode the other, <hi>Hannibal</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolv'd to poſſeſs it; and for that he was well aſſur'd, the <hi>Roman</hi> embolden'd by his late Succeſs would oppoſe him, he therefore devis'd this Stratagem. The Country round about, near this piece of Ground, was, in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61906:253"/>truth, plain and Champaign, no part thereof ſeeming in any wiſe capable of Ambuſhes; but, foraſmuch as in the plaineſt Countries there are little inſenſible Riſings and Fallings, Turnings and Windings, Rocks and Caverns, where Men may be conceal'd, as here there was, wherefore in theſe places he hid five Hundred Horſe, and five Thouſand Foot, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Parties of two and three Hundred in a Diviſion, according to the capacity of the places where they were to lodge; and to be ſo diſpos'd that the Enemies Foragers might not diſcover them: This done, he order'd his light-arm'd Troops to march, and take poſſeſſion of the Ground we mention'd; whereupon <hi>Minutius,</hi> who concluded the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had given him a new occaſion of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, orders out his light-arm'd Troops to attack them, and after theſe his Horſe, while he himſelf follow'd with the groſs of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in Battalia, keeping their Order.</p>
                     <p>The Sun was now riſen, and while every Bodies Eyes were fix'd on the place of Action, <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Ambuſh riſeth, and advanceth by degrees unobſerv'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi> While <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the mean while was not ſlack to ſend Succours conſtantly to the Charge, and at length advancing himſelf at the head of his Horſe, and the reſt of the Army, the Horſe on both ſides came ſoon to ingage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the light-arm'd <hi>Romans,</hi> not being a match for the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horſe, were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61906:253"/>and retreated to their Body, putting them in great diſorder. Hitherto the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh remain'd expecting the Signal to fall on, which being now given, they come boldly to the Charge, and attack the <hi>Romans</hi> on all ſides, as well on the groſs as the light-arm'd Troops, ſo that the diſpute was very warm and bloody. And now <hi>Fabius,</hi> who ſaw how things went, and fear'd leſt <hi>Minutius</hi> and his Army ſhould be loſt, march'd out of his Works, and came in to his relief, who was at his laſt ſtake; whereupon the <hi>Romans,</hi> who before were broken and diſorder'd, obſerving his approach, took Heart and rally'd about their Enſigns, and made a ſtand, after their having loſt many of their light-arm'd Men, and more of the beſt and braveſt of their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary Soldiers. Upon the coming in of the freſh Legions that advanc'd to the Relief bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in firm order, <hi>Hannibal</hi> began to be in doubt, and therefore founded a Retreat, and commanded his People from the Purſuit. And now all Men juſtly judg'd, who were ingag'd in the dangers of this Action, and in a word concluded, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had been beaten by the raſhneſs of <hi>Minutius,</hi> and that the Common-wealth had been at this time, and always heretofore, preſerv'd and reſcu'd through the wiſe and ſlow Temper of <hi>Fabius.</hi> And they were ſoon ſatisfy'd in <hi>Rome</hi> of the wide diſſerence there was between the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a good General of an Army, and a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61906:254"/>raſh hot-headed Soldier. Wherefore the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> now taught by ſharp Experience, thought it Wiſdom for the time to come to abide in a Body, and in one Camp, and that none was ſit to be obey'd but <hi>Fabius.</hi> As for the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> after they had made a Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between their Camp and this piece of Ground, and had Garriſon'd and well Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the Poſt, and perform'd what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſecure it from any further danger, they betook themſelves to their Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>And now the time for election of their Conſuls at <hi>Rome</hi> was come, where <hi>L. Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and <hi>C. Terentius</hi> were choſen, and the Dictator's Authority thereby ſuperſeded. As to the laſt Years Conſuls, <hi>Cn. Servilius</hi> and <hi>M. Regulus,</hi> who had fill'd the place of <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> they were inveſted by <hi>Aemilius</hi> with Pro-conſular Power, and having the Camp committed to their Charge, had the entire preſent Conduct of the War. In the mean time <hi>Aemilius</hi> took care to make new Levies, after he had imparted his Counſels to the Senate, and ſent Recruits likewiſe to fill up the Legions. Orders were alſo diſpatch'd to <hi>Servilius</hi> to be careful not to ingage in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Battel, but to exerciſe the Troops as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as occaſion ſerv'd in Skirmiſhes and Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, to acquaint the young Soldiers with Danger and their Duty, and qualifie them for more important Occaſions. For they were
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61906:254"/>perſuaded that much of their misfortune in the War hitherto, was owing to the rawneſs and inexperience of their Troops, who had not for the moſt part ſeen any Action of weight. The Senate likewiſe diſpatch'd the Praetor <hi>Poſthumius</hi> into <hi>Gaul,</hi> to endeavour to bring over thoſe who had taken Arms under <hi>Hannibal</hi> to another Mind; furthermore, it was committed to his Care to Conduct over the Army that had winter'd at <hi>Lilybae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They likewiſe ſupply'd the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, who conducted the War in <hi>Spain,</hi> with whatſoever they could be thought to need. In a word, both Conſuls and Senate acted with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in all things that might avail towards a vigorous proſecution of the War. As ſoon as <hi>Servilius</hi> had receiv'd the Conſuls Orders, he carefully put them in execution, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every other thing that related to his Charge; but for Occurrences, there happen'd nothing memorable enough to be related; whether it was that his Inſtructions were too much limitted, or that the Seaſon of the Year permitted him not to enter on any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Action, but little was done towards the advancement of their Affairs. What was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd was by Pickeering, and ſmall and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Skirmiſhes and Rencounters, wherein the Leaders were not without their ſhare of ſome Praiſe, acting in their Poſts always with ſingular Temper and Prudence.</p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:61906:255"/>
                     <p>Thus then the two Armies remain'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd in view of each other all the Winter, and a good part of the Spring. But as ſoon as <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaw there was Forage to be had, he decamp'd from under <hi>Gerunium,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there was nothing ſo advantageous for his Affairs, as to labour by all ways poſſible to compel the Enemy to come to a Battel. In the mean time, he beſieg'd and took the Citadel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> where the <hi>Romans</hi> had laid up their Corn and Proviſions of War for the Service of the Army. The Town had been demoliſh'd the Year before; and having now loſt the Fortreſs, with all their Proviſion and Stores within it, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army became greatly ſtreighten'd; and were not only preſs'd through want of Proviſions, which they could not now obtain but with great difficulty, the Enemy being poſſeſs'd of their Magazine; but alſo becauſe the Fortreſs of <hi>Cannoe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the whole Country round about.</p>
                     <p>They therefore diſpatch'd Meſſenger on Meſſenger to <hi>Rome,</hi> for Inſtructions how to comport themſelves; letting them underſtand, That if the Enemy approach'd and preſs'd them, there would be no means left to avoid coming to a Battel; and that the Country being every-where waſted and deſtroy'd, their Allies began to grow jealous of their Safety, and ſeem'd only at preſent to ſtand in a ſort of doubtful Neutrality, to take their meaſures as the ſucceſs of a Battel ſhould determine
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61906:255"/>them. Whereupon the Senate came to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that they ſhould give the Enemy Battel: Howbeit, they admoniſh'd <hi>Cneius</hi> to deferr it, if poſſible, to the coming of the Conſuls, whom they now diſpatch'd away. All People's Eyes were now on <hi>Aemilius,</hi> their Hopes being in him, as well on account of his Vertue, as for that he had not long before conducted the War in <hi>Illyria,</hi> much to the Honour of the Republick. It was decreed, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Army ſhould conſiſt of eight Legions; which was what the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had never before done; and that each Legion ſhould conſiſt of five Thouſand, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Succours of the Confederates. For, as we have hitherto obſerv'd, the <hi>Roman</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was to march out every Year with four Legions, each containing four Thouſand Foot, and two Hundred Horſe; but now that they were thus threaten'd, they thought ſit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Legions of five Thouſand Foot, and three Hundred Horſe, to which was added an equal number of <hi>Latin</hi> Auxiliary Foot, and for the moſt part thrice the number of Horſe. It was the cuſtom to aſſign to each Conſul the one half of theſe Auxiliary Troops, with two Legions, when they march'd on any Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but they ſeldom employ'd more than one of their Conſuls to manage any one War, with two Legions and the Auxiliaries, as we have obſerv'd; and but very rarely it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were driven to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61906:256"/>all their Forces to finiſh any one War. Nevertheleſs, they were now ſo terrify'd, that they conceiv'd eight Legions to be little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>After the Senate then had exhorted <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to comport himſelf in that occaſion as became the Majeſty of the Common-wealth, and had remonſtrated to him of what mighty importance a Battel at that conjuncture was, they diſmiſs'd him. As ſoon as the Conſuls arriv'd at their Camp, they caus'd the Army to be drawn together, imparting to them the Pleaſure of the Senate, and exhorting them to behave themſelves as became them. It was <hi>Aemilius</hi> who ſpoke to them; whoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe principally tended to Apologize for paſt Failures; for the Soldiers had been ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited by ſo many calamitous Adventures, that they ſtood in need enough of good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. He therefore did his beſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them, That if they had been vanquiſh'd in former Occaſions, it was not one or two, but manifold Reaſons that might be render'd for their Misfortunes; but that now if they had the Hearts of <hi>Romans,</hi> there was not one which he could foreſee, that might debarr them of Victory, and triumphing over their Enemy: That their two Conſuls never were join'd before, to conduct their Affairs with their joint Legions, all aſſembled in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: That the Soldiers till now were not fit for Service, the State being ſerv'd by an Army
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61906:256"/>of Novices, raw and untrain'd to their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unus'd to the Toils and Perils of War; and what was of greater moment, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ey had to do with a ſtrange Enemy, whom they had hardly ever ſeen, before they came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with him: That, in ſhort, thoſe who had been defeated near the River <hi>Trebia,</hi> were hurry'd to a Battel, within two Days after their arrival from a weariſome Voyage from <hi>Sicily:</hi> That the others, who loſt the Day in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> did not ſo much as ſee the Enemy that beat them; not only before the Battel, but during the Action it ſelf, the Miſt and Darkneſs ſo hid them; but that now at this time, there was not room to alledge one of theſe Reaſons: For firſt, they had with them both the Conſuls, who were not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves equally expos'd to the Dangers with them; but they had ſo prevail'd, that the laſt Year's Conſuls themſelves, whoſe Magiſtracy was now expir'd, did not refuſe to ſtay and partake the Fortune of the Battel: That as to the Soldiers, they had now had time to acquaint themſelves with the Enemy, their Arms, Order, Numbers, and manner of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it having been near two Years that they had been in continual action againſt them; ſo that Circumſtances being totally chang'd from what they were, they ought likewiſe to expect a change of Fortune. And further, That it was not to be doubted, nor ſcarce poſſible to come to paſs, that having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61906:257"/>the Enemy in ſo many late Combats and Rencounters, without any odds in their numbers, they ſhould fail of Victory in a Battel, while they were to fight with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſurmounting the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> by at leaſt one half. <hi>In a word (Fellow-Soldiers,</hi> ſays the Conſul) <hi>ſince every thing ſeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Victory, it only reſts that you ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry your Hearts with you into the Field, and a Determination to Vanquiſh; and yet when I have ſaid all, it is not you that ſtand in need of Exhortation; ſuch Methods are only proper for Mercenaries, who ſight meerly for Pay, or Allies who are conſtrain'd by Stipulations to hazard themſelves for their Confederates, and without any proſpect of bettering their Fortune, let the Succeſs happen which way it will: But you who come not into the Field to ſight a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Cauſe, but for your ſelves, your Country, your Wives and Children, who are at preſent in a doubtful caſe through the many Dangers that threaten them, and whoſe Condition the Succeſs of a Battel will greatly change: You (I ſay) need but only to be minded, not admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd of theſe things: For who is he among you, who had not rather vanquiſh by Fighting, or otherwiſe die in the Diſpute, than lead a wretched Life, beholding theſe deareſt Pledges I nam'd, a Prey to a mercileſs Enemy. In a word then, reſolve without Incitements from any thing I can utter, and take Counſel from your own Reflections, of the difference between
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61906:257"/>the Vanquiſh'd and the Victor, what Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences you are to hope, and what Calamities to fear: And draw your Swords inſpir'd with ſuch Thoughts, and bear in mind that you ſight not now only for the Honour and Preſervation of an Army, but for your Country and the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire; and in ſuch caſe, what uſe can there be of Perſuaſions? If you ſight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfully, and chance to be Vanquiſh'd, your Country will be left wholly without Succour; ſhe hath depoſited all her Strength in your hands, all her Power, all her Hopes of Safety; you will do well therefore, Fellow-Soldiers, to determine not to violate ſo great a Truſt, in an Occaſion of ſuch mighty moment; act then correſpondent to ſuch an Obligation, and expreſs your Gratitude as becomes you. In a word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your ſelves ſo, that it may appear to the whole World, that if heretofore the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth hath ſuſtain'd Damage and Reproach, it was not becauſe the</hi> Roman <hi>Vertue gave place to the</hi> Carthaginian, <hi>but meerly to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Inexperience of our Armies in thoſe times, unlucky Conjunctures, and ill choice of Ground to fight in.</hi> After this Diſcourſe, and others of the like Contents, to animate the Soldiers, he diſmiſs'd the Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>The next Day the Conſuls march'd the Army toward the Enemy, and the Day after came within ſix Miles of their Camp. <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who obſerv'd the Country to be all plain and champaign Ground, declar'd his Opinion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61906:258"/>againſt coming there to a Battel, foraſmuch as the Enemy much over-match'd them in Horſe, and that it therefore concern'd them to draw the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> if poſſible, into ſuch Ground as gave the advantage to Foot; but, in regard <hi>Terentius,</hi> who knew no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would not be won to his Opinion, it came to paſs, which ſeldom fails in Military Affairs, that the two Leaders ſell at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>The next Day then, when <hi>Terentius</hi> had the Command, (for it is the Cuſtom of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Conſuls to Command in their turns) decamp'd the Army much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Aemilius</hi>'s liking, and advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Enemy. Whereupon <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them approach, mov'd toward them with his light-arm'd Troops, and his Horſe, and boldly attack'd them: But the <hi>Romans</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd the firſt ſhock by mingling ſome of their heavy-arm'd Troops among their light-arm'd Soldiers, and re-inforc'd theſe with their Archers and their Horſe, and in the end had the better of the Diſpute. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, that the Body of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Troops did little or nothing to ſuſtain thoſe that fought, while the <hi>Romans</hi> had mingled, I ſay, certain <hi>Cohorts</hi> with their light-arm'd Soldiers, who fought at the ſame time. In ſhort, the Night parted them, but in truth with other Succeſs than what the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> expected when he engag'd: And the next
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61906:258"/>Day <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who approv'd not the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of coming then to a Battel, and ſaw he could not now retreat from the Ground where he was, without great Hazard, intrench'd himſelf near the River <hi>Aufidus,</hi> with about two third parts of the Army. This River only, of all the reſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> takes its courſe through the <hi>Apennines,</hi> for all the other <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Rivers are diſpers'd, ſome emptying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Sea of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> others toward the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea; but the <hi>Aufidus,</hi> which croſſeth the <hi>Apennines,</hi> hath its ſource in that part of <hi>Italy</hi> that borders on the <hi>Tuſcan</hi>-Sea, and runs into the <hi>Adriatick. Aemilius</hi> then poſted the reſt of his Army on the other ſide the River, toward that part that is Fordable, ſomewhat more than a Miles diſtance from his other Camp, and a further ſpace from the Enemies; in this place he order'd them to intrench, to the end he might be the better able to ſuccour and ſuſtain his Foragers that went from either Camp, and to attack with more eaſe the Enemies, whenſoever they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd abroad on the ſame Errand.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Hannibal,</hi> perceiving the time of Battel to approach, and fearing leſt his ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the laſt Ingagement, ſhould have blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Mettle of his Soldiers, thought it therefore adviſable to ſpeak to the Army, and thereupon Orders them to be drawn together to that purpoſe; and when they were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he bid them behold and ſurvey the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61906:259"/>Country round about, and then demanded, what they could wiſh more, if the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had left them at liberty to chuſe a place to fight in, than that wherein they now ſtood, ſurpaſſing (as they did) the Enemy ſo much in Horſe? <hi>We ought firſt then</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to acknowledge it a Bleſſing from Heaven, that in order to Victory hath conducted the Enemy hither. In the next place, you are to allow me a ſhare of your Thanks, by whoſe management they are at length driven to a neceſſity of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us Battel; for they cannot chuſe now but fight, in a place which of all others they would refuſe, were it left to their choice. In ſhort, I ſee no neceſſity to entertain you with many Words to animate you to go on chearfully. I might perhaps ſpeak to you on that Subject, and labour to incite you to do Gallantly were you now to learn what the</hi> Romans <hi>can do, for then indeed it might concern us to endeavour, both by Words and Examples to inſpire you with Thoughts worthy of you; but at this time of Day, after we have thrice vanquiſh'd them in three ſucceſſive pitch'd Battels, what Speech, or what Eloquence can ſo well perſwade you, as the Succeſs of your own Actions? By the Battels you have already won, you have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd the Country, and by that means reap'd the Harveſt of plenty of every good and needful thing, and my Promiſe to you therein made good; and the Effects have prov'd, that I meant what I ſaid. It now only remains, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61906:259"/>we make our ſelves Maſters of their Cities and Towns, and the Riches and Treaſure they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: If we compaſs that,</hi> Italy <hi>it ſelf is ours. This ſingle Battel will finiſh all our Labours; and by giving us the Empire, and all that the</hi> Romans <hi>call theirs, we become Maſters and Lords of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe. There is no need then of Language but of Hearts and Hands, and I trust, by the Favour of the Gods, you will ſoon ſee the happy accompliſhment of all I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <hi>Hannibal</hi> had thus ſpoken, and the Army had given evidence both by their Voice and their Actions, that they approv'd what he had ſaid, he remanded them to their Poſts; having firſt prais'd their. Forwardneſs, and the Reſolution they had manifeſted, and preſently march'd and encamp'd on the other ſide the River, where the groſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army lay. The next Day, after having order'd the Army to take their repaſt, he bid them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Action; and, the Day following, drawing up his Troops along the River, he preſented Battel to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But <hi>Aemili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> not liking the Ground, and believing that want of Proviſion would ſoon conſtrain <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> to decamp, he therefore mov'd not, but took care only to have the two Camps well fortify'd; Whereupon <hi>Hannibal</hi> march'd back to his own, after having ſtood a while drawn up in Battalia in expectation of the Enemy.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61906:260"/>After this he ſent out his <hi>Numidians</hi> to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thoſe of the leſſer Camp as they came to their watering place; but <hi>Terentius</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during they ſhould thus dare him ſo near his Works, and hinder his Soldiers from ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Neceſſities, became the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by ſuch Bravado's to come to blows, nor were the Soldiers leſs impatient; ſo true it is, that no time ſeems ſo tedious, as the ſpace between Reſolving and Executing, when once we have determin'd to abide the Dangers and Difficulties that lie in the way to our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                     <p>When the News came to <hi>Rome</hi> that the Armies drew near each other, and that they were daily Pickeering and Ingaging by Parties, the People were every where in great fear and ſuſpence, and the memory of ſo many late Defeats terrify'd them with the apprehenſion of the iſſue of the approaching Battel; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſie to foreſee the deplorable ſtate of the Republick in caſe of a Defeat. Nothing was talk'd of in <hi>Rome</hi> but menaces out of their <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s Books, and ſcarce any thing was ſeen in Temples and Houſes, but Spectres and ill-boding Prodigies, ſo that all their time was ſpent in Vows, Sacrifices and Supplications. For 'tis a Cuſtom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> in any Extremities or Streights in their Affairs, to omit nothing that they conceive may be of uſe to avert the Anger or Danger that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them either from the Gods or Men; and,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61906:260"/>in a word, there is nothing on ſuch occaſions done or ſaid among them, that is held either Superſtitious or unbecoming the Dignity of the Government.</p>
                     <p>The Day being now come when <hi>Terentius</hi> had the Authority, he took the <hi>Faſces,</hi> and the Sun was hardly riſen, when he order'd the Army to move out of their Camps, rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe in the greater Camp in order of Battel as they march'd out; thoſe of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Camp he drew up in a long Line, joining them at the extremity with the others, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all that ſide of the Ground that look'd toward the South. In the Right-Wing he poſted the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, filling with them the ſpace between the reſt and the River The Foot he diſpos'd in the ſame manner, but in cloſer Order in the Rear than in the Front, in regard the number of the <hi>Cohorts</hi> was doubled. On the left Wing was plac'd the Horſe of the Conſederates, the light-arm'd Troops were advanc'd ſome diſtance before the Line of Battel; the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Army (taking in the Troops of the Allies) conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fourſcore Thouſand Foot, and ſix Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Hannibal</hi> order'd the <hi>Baleares</hi> and light-arm'd Troops to paſs the River, poſting them advanc'd before the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Then commanding the Groſs of the Army to march, he paſs'd the River likewiſe in two places, and rang'd them in order of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61906:261"/>Battel fronting the Enemy. On the left point, being the part neareſt the River, he poſted his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Horſe, oppoſed to that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> next theſe he plac'd the one half of his <hi>African</hi> Foot, who bare weighty Armour, their Flank being likewiſe ſecur'd by the reſt of the <hi>Africans.</hi> His <hi>Numidian</hi> Horſe he poſted on the Right Wing; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having thus form'd his Line of Battel, drawn out in length, and of equal depth, he made the Centre, or middle Battalions, which was compos'd of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Legiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to move a little forward, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that the Figure, when they had ſo done, with the two Wings, might be liken'd to a Yoak, Creſcent-wiſe or convex'd in the mid'ſt; for having propos'd that the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould firſt engage, the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> were poſted at hand ſo as to fortifie and ſuſtain them.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Africans</hi> were arm'd after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, being well furniſh'd for that Service out of the Spoils of the Enemy in former Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Bucklers were of one ſort, but their Swords were not alike. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> wear Swords ſhort, ſtiff, and pointed, fit both for cutting and thruſting; but the <hi>Gauls</hi> were only for cutting-ſtrokes. In a word, it was a ſurpriſing Sight to behold them; for the <hi>Gauls</hi> were ſtripp'd naked from the Waſte upward; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> clad in white Linen-Caſſocks, border'd with Purple,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61906:261"/>after the faſhion of their Country. In <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s Army there were ten Thouſand Horſe; but the Foot, taking in the Auxiliaries and all, did not exceed forty Thouſand. In the <hi>Roman</hi> Battel, <hi>Aemilius</hi> was poſted in the Right, <hi>Terentius</hi> in the Left, and the laſt Year's Conſuls, <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> and <hi>Cn. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius</hi> led the Body. On the part of the <hi>Carthaginians, Aſdrubal</hi> was poſted on the Right Wing, <hi>Hanno</hi> on the Left, and <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> led the Body, accompany'd by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mago.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Army fac'd toward the South, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the North; ſo that the riſing Sun moleſted neither.</p>
                     <p>The Forlorn, or advanc'd Parties began the Day, and theſe light-arm'd Troops contended for a while with equal Courage and Succeſs; but as ſoon as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Horſe on the Left Wing advanc'd againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> the Battel grew hot and bloody: For they fought not now, as had been the cuſtom in other Battels, by charging and wheeling off, and then returning to the Charge: But here, when once they came to join, the Horſe-men mingling, and often diſengaging from their Horſes, fought it out Man to Man on Foot. But the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horſe in the end prevail'd, killing the greateſt part of the <hi>Romans</hi> on the place, tho' their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was without blame. Thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to eſcape, took along the River, but
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61906:262"/>were moſt of them cut off, <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> giving no Quarter. And now the Cohorts taking place of the light-arm'd Troops, it was there likewiſe hotly diſputed for a ſpace; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> who did not preſently loſe their Order, were at length broken, and forc'd to give ground to the ſuperior number of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and retreating back, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, or convex Part of the Figure, which was form'd by this Body of Men, and who firſt engag'd, ſunk back into the void ſpace in the Rear. The <hi>Roman</hi> Cohorts eagerly purſuing the advantage, eaſily pierc'd the Body of the Enemy's Battel, which was but weak, and compos'd only of <hi>Gauls,</hi> to the place where the Battalions ſtood in cloſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In ſhort, the <hi>Romans</hi> thus preſſing the Enemy, who open'd to the Right and Left to give them paſſage, advanc'd ſo far into the void ſpace, that they had now the <hi>African</hi> Foot, who bare weighty Armour on their Flank both ways; who moving from the Right and Left Wings inwards, charg'd the <hi>Romans</hi> on both their Flanks at once, each acting as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion advis'd.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, every thing came to paſs as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> had skilfully devis'd; for the <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whom he well knew were not their match, became at length encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61906:262"/>by the <hi>Africans:</hi> By which means they were ſo enclos'd, that they were not able to fight in a Body, but, as it were, Man to Man, or by ſmall Parties againſt ſtrong Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that preſs'd them from all Parts. And now foraſmuch as <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who was poſted in the Right Wing, and had his ſhare in the Conflict with <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and the Horſe; yet being hitherto unhurt, and willing to equal his Actions with his Words, by which he had encourag'd the Army, ſeeing that all the Hopes they had left was in their Foot, he charg'd through the Enemy's Battel, killing and forcing all that ſtood in his way, where he did his utmoſt to encourage his People; <hi>Hannibal</hi> acting the ſame Part in the ſame Poſt, having from the beginning conducted that part of his Army in Perſon.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Numidians,</hi> who fought in the Righ: Wing againſt <hi>Varro,</hi> and the Horſe that were poſted in the Left Wing of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> neither they nor the others acted any thing memorable on that ſide, ſaving that the <hi>Numidians</hi> ſo amus'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> by beating about them, now offering to charge in one place, now in another, that they were thereby prevented from ſuccouring thoſe that were elſewhere diſtreſs'd. But now that <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> had compleated his Victory, and deſtroy'd the greateſt part of the Horſe whom he had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd along the River, and was return'd to re-enforce the <hi>Numidians;</hi> then the Horſe of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61906:263"/>the <hi>Roman</hi> Allies beholding their Danger, turn'd their backs. 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in this occaſion perform'd an artful and prudent part; who well knowing that the <hi>Numidians</hi> were ſingular at the purſuit of a ſlying Enemy, he therefore order'd them to follow hard after the running <hi>Romans,</hi> while he, heading a Body of Foot, advanc'd to re-enforce the <hi>Africans;</hi> and coming in, fell on the Rear of the <hi>Romans</hi> Battel, and charg'd them likewiſe elſewhere with certain Squadrons of Horſe, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearten'd the <hi>Africans,</hi> and as much terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the <hi>Romans. L. Aemilius,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd many Wounds, dy'd in the Battel, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had liv'd to act in every thing the part of an able and vertuous Citizen, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this occaſion. The <hi>Romans</hi> reſiſted yet: a while; but as their Men fell, their Ground by degrees became more and more ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, till at length they were ſo huddled up, that they had not ſpace to move and weild their Arms; ſo they were all put to the Sword. The two Conſuls of the preceding Year like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fell in this occaſion, Men of great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for their Wiſdom and Probity, and who in this Action gave noble Proofs of the power and extent of <hi>Roman</hi> Vertue. While matters paſs'd thus here, the <hi>Numidians,</hi> who went in purſuit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, kill'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them, and took ſome Priſoners. A few got into <hi>Venuſia,</hi> and among theſe the Conſul <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> a Perſon every way
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61906:263"/>unworthy, and who was choſen into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy for a Curſe to his Country.</p>
                     <p>This iſſue had the Field of <hi>Cannae,</hi> famous for the number of illuſtrious Men there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on both ſides, as well on the part of the Vanquiſh'd, as the Victors. And certainly the Action it ſelf witneſſeth its own Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for of ſix Thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, there eſcap'd no more than Seventy, who got with the Conſul into <hi>Venuſia;</hi> and about three Hundred of the Allies, ſome by one means, ſome by another. As to the Foot, ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were made Priſoners, who were not in the Action: Of the reſt, not above three Thouſand eſcap'd, all the reſt dying bravely with their Swords in their Hands, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Seventy Thouſand. In a word, the great advantage the Enemy had in Horſe, mainly contributed to their Succeſs; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitable Inſtruction may be gather'd by remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from hence, That it is more ſafe to Fight with one halſ the number of Foot leſs, while you exceed the Enercy in Horſe, than to have both ſides equal in Foot and Horſe in a Battel. But this Victory came not cheap to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians;</hi> for there dy'd in Battel on their part, four Thouſand <hi>Gauls,</hi> fifteen Hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> and about two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of their Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> who were taken Priſoners were not in the Battel, for <hi>Aemilius</hi> had left then in the Camp with Orders to march and attack
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61906:264"/>that of the Enemy after the Battel ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, thereby to become Maſters of their Stores and Ammunition, in caſe <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhould chance to leave his Camp without a good Guard, and in caſe he did, he was ſure to find his Army thereby diminiſh'd, and the <hi>Romans</hi> with leſs buſineſs on their hands. Theſe then were taken much after this manner. Tho' <hi>Hannibal</hi> left not his Camp without a good Guard, nevertheleſs, as ſoon as the Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the <hi>Romans,</hi> purſuant to their Orders, march'd to the Attack; the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for a while gallantly oppoſing them, but at length, when they were on the point of yielding to the ſuperiour force of the Enemy, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was by that time Maſter of the Field, came in to their Relief, and routing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> forc'd them to take Refuge in their own Camp; of theſe were kill'd about two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, the reſt were taken alive. Such as were ſcatter'd and diſpers'd about the Country, and had got into Fortify'd Places, ſhar'd no better Fortune, for the <hi>Numidians</hi> attack'd them where-ever they went, taking to the number of two Thouſand of their Horſe Priſoners, as we before noted. The iſſue of this Battel prov'd in effect what either Party foreſaw; for the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> thereby became ſoon poſſeſs'd, in a manner at leaſt, of all that part of <hi>Italy</hi> call'd the <hi>Ancient Province,</hi> and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-Graecia.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> the <hi>Arpinates,</hi> and ſome <hi>Capuans,</hi> putting themſelves preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61906:264"/>into their hands, and all the reſt giving manifeſt ſigns of their good Inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. Nor was <hi>Hannibal</hi> in doubt, but that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf would be his on the firſt Attempt; while the <hi>Romans</hi> became now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate (after this Defeat) of preſerving their Dominion of <hi>Italy.</hi> And under theſe Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, terrify'd at once at their own and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Danger, expected every moment to ſee <hi>Hannibal</hi> at their Gates. And, as if Fortune had a mind to make them drink the Dreggs of this bitter Cup, they receiv'd news ſhortly after (while the City was ſinking under the weight of their Adverſity) that their Praetor, whom they had ſent to the <hi>Ciſalpine Gauls,</hi> was himſelf with his whole Army routed and cut off, by an Ambuſh they had laid in his way. Howbeit, the Senate deſerted not their Duty in this exigent. They call'd on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to ſtrengthen the Works of the City, and gave all thoſe needful Orders which their Circumſtances would permit, as by the ſucceſs ſoon appear'd. And tho' in truth the whole World was now witneſs, that the <hi>Romans</hi> at this time were vanquiſh'd, and gave place in Military Reputation to their Enemy; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it will alſo be confeſs'd, That what by their Conſtancy of Mind, and the Wiſdom of their Counſels, they overcame at length theſe their Conquerors, and not only reſcu'd their Country, but added not long after to their recovery of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Conqueſt of the World.</p>

                     <p>IN our foregoing Book we have related the Cauſes of the Second War that fell out between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> We have deliver'd the Particulars of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s March, and Invaſion of <hi>Italy;</hi> and have recounted the Adventures of the two Armies, to the time of the Battel that was ſought on the Banks of the River. <hi>Anfidus,</hi>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61906:269"/>near <hi>Cannae.</hi> Now the Occurrences of <hi>Greece,</hi> during the ſame Period of time, ſhall be the Subject of our Pains. But we have thought it neceſſary to remind the Reader briefly: Firſt, Of what hath been already obſerv'd of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in our Second Book, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of the <hi>Achaians.</hi> Inaſmuch as it hath ſo come to paſs, that in the ſhort ſpace of ours and our Fathers Days, that Republick hath grown to a marvellous Greatneſs. For being founded by <hi>Tiſamenes,</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> we have obſerv'd that the <hi>Achaians</hi> were firſt govern'd by Kings, who ſprang from him in a continu'd Line of Succeſſion to the Reign of <hi>Ogyges:</hi> From whoſe time, the Supreme Power being tranſlated to the People, became eſtabliſh'd in an excellent form of Government: Which was afterward firſt broken and diſſolv'd by the Kings of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> when the Cities and Towns thereof became independent; each governing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own Rules, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Subjection to a Supreme General Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, to which they might have recourſe. After this Revolution, we ſhew'd how they came to Unite and Incorporate into one Body; at what time it was that they came to this Reſolution; and who they were that gave the Occaſion. In ſhort, we have related by what Means and Counſels the Towns being drawn to Unite, the whole People of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> grew to have one common Appellation, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61906:269"/>to be under one and the ſame Form of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. After having treated in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of that Enterprize, and ſaid ſomething in particular touching the Actions of the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> we purſu'd the Story down to the time, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> was deſpoil'd of his Government. Then we gave a brief Recapitulation of general Occurrences to the Death of <hi>Antigonus, Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi> who all dy'd about the ſame time; having promis'd to begin our Hiſtory at that Period, which gave an end to thoſe Matters we have now laſt recited.</p>
                     <p>In concluſion, I determin'd, that I could not any where better begin than from thence: Firſt, In regard that there <hi>Aratus</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth his Commentaries, ſo that by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the Thread of his Diſcourſe, we ſhall thereby make the relation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as far as we propoſe to touch them, all of a piece; and then it will come to paſs, that the time ſucceeding, and that which ſhall compoſe our Hiſtory, will be ſo united to the foregoing Period, that in part what ſhall be related of our own, and the Tranſactions of our Fathers Days, will be compriz'd in one Body. For as I have been a Witneſs to a good part of what ſhall be deliver'd, and compos'd the reſt from the Relations of ſuch as could yield me the like certain Teſtimony; ſo I have ſhun'd the delivering of remoter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61906:270"/>Occurrences, through the doubts to which they are ſubjected: And have thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of an Hiſtorian's Pen beyond that Period. Nor indeed can Truth farther fairly be ſhewn, nor Men conſequently ſafely judge of any thing they hear otherwiſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. A farther particular Motive we had for taking our beginning from thence was, that Fortune ſeem'd at that time to have made an univerſal Revolution, and given a new Face to the Affairs of the World.</p>
                     <p>Tho' <hi>Philip,</hi> Son of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> were yet a Child, nevertheleſs he ſoon came to ſway the Scepter of <hi>Macedon. Achaeus,</hi> who govern'd the Countries of <hi>Aſia</hi> on this ſide Mount <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> did not only bear the Port of a Prince, but was in effect veſted with Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ſirnam'd the Great, a little before, ſucceeded his Brother in the Kingdom of <hi>Syria;</hi> being then but very young. And <hi>Ariarathes</hi> took poſſeſſion at the ſame time of the Kingdom of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which was deliver'd into his hands. About the ſame time <hi>Ptolemy Philopater</hi> reduc'd <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to his Obedience. And a little after <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> became eſtabliſh'd King of the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on that ſide had newly made <hi>Hannibal</hi> their General, in order to thoſe Attempts we have already recounted. So that the Government, as one may ſay, of the World being put into new hands, it could not by the Law of Nature but beget new
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61906:270"/>Counſels, and produce new Things. The <hi>Romans</hi> then enter'd upon the War we have related. <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> were ſoon in Hoſtility one againſt the other, for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Lower <hi>Syria:</hi> And the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> joyn'd in a War againſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Aetolia:</hi> The reaſons of which War we ſhall now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Aetolians</hi> had been long weary of Peace, which oblig'd them to live Honeſtly at their own Expence, who had been us'd heretofore to ſubſiſt on Spoil and Rapine. And whoſoever hath lead that ſort of Life, without proſpect of other Profit, than what ariſeth by the Damage of another, after the manner of Savage Beaſts, are without any ſence of Friendſhip or Alliance; reckon all their Enemies they can prey on; and believe they have a right to any thing they can take away. Nevertheleſs, during the Life of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus,</hi> the ſear the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were under of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> withheld them a while from Violence; but he was no ſooner dead, and <hi>Philip,</hi> then very young, come to the Crown, when ſetting little by his Youth, they meditated by what means or pretexts they might make War on the <hi>Peloponneſians;</hi> whom after their ancient Cuſtom they had a mind to plunder; and believ'd they had a better right to make War on the <hi>Achaians,</hi> than any other People whatſoever. While
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61906:271"/>they were thus conſulting, there happen'd an accident that further'd their purpoſe, and which, in ſhort, they made uſe of to colour it. <hi>Dorimachus</hi> of <hi>Trichonia</hi> was Son of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſtratus,</hi> who had acted ſo perfidious a part in the Aſſembly of the <hi>Baeotians.</hi> This <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimachus,</hi> a turbulent young Man, and every way an <hi>Aetolian,</hi> (and after their manner) looking with a covetous Eye on other Mens Poſſeſſions, was employ'd by Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>Phigalia,</hi> a Town of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhew of taking care for the Security and Defence of the Town and Territory; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Commiſſion was to make Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from thence of the Tranſactions of <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſus.</hi> Soon after his arrival there drew a numerous confluence thither from ſundry Quarters, of looſe piratical People, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him, then reſiding in that Town, which was a Confederate of the? <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and ſituate on the Frontiers of the <hi>Meſſenians;</hi> and he, not being able to gratiſie theſe Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with the Prey they hunted after, (the Peace of <hi>Antigonus</hi> as yet ſubſiſting among the <hi>Greeks</hi>) and, in ſhort, having no better way to entertain them, permitted them to ſpoil the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> of their Cattel, who were alſo Friends and Confederates of the <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Who beginning on the Skirts of their Frontiers, driving away their Herds from thence, their Inſolence grew at length to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch of their Habitations by Night, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61906:271"/>lay at any diſtance diſpers'd about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The <hi>Meſſenians</hi> were thereupon urg'd to diſpatch their Deputies with Complaints of thoſe Outrages to <hi>Dorimachus,</hi> and to demand reparation of the wrongs they had receiv'd; who did not only not incline to redreſs them, but ſeem'd rather to incourage thoſe who bare Arms under him, and indeed to inrich himſelf by ſharing a good proportion of all their Booty. But at length being preſs'd by new and frequent Importunities, his People continuing to act every day new Villanies, he told the Deputies he would come himſelf to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and do right to thoſe, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of Injuries done them by the <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But upon his coming, and the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe who had been thus moleſted, ſome he diſmiſs'd with Scoffs, others by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further Injuries to thoſe they had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd, and terrifying others with hard and menacing Language. In ſhort, it ſo happen'd, that while <hi>Dorimachus</hi> remain'd at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> this lewd Rabble approaching near the Town in the Night, rifled a certain Country-Houſe call'd <hi>Chyron,</hi> where killing all that made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they bound the reſt in Chains, and carry'd them away, together with the Cattle. Whereupon the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> who had long lain under the reſentment of this barbarous Treatment, and the little account <hi>Dorimachus</hi> ſeem'd to make of their Complaints, cited him to appear before their Aſſembly. <hi>Sciron</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61906:272"/>happen'd to be at this time their Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, of whom ſo his Vertue his fellow Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens had a ſingular eſteem. He was of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that <hi>Dorimachus</hi> ſhould be held under reſtraint till reparation were made of the Damages they had ſuffer'd, and the Authors of the Slaughter that had been committed were deliver'd into their hands; which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was thought but juſt, and had the ready concurrence of the Aſſembly. <hi>Dorimachus</hi> inrag'd at this proceeding, angrily told them, That they ſhew'd themſelves but weak in ſuch a Determination, if they could not diſtinguiſh that thereby they did not affront him, but the whole <hi>Aetolian</hi> People; that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was unaccountable; and that it would not be long ere it were reveng'd. There was at this time a certain ridiculous Fellow in <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina</hi> call'd <hi>Babyrtas,</hi> who was every way ſo like <hi>Dorimachus,</hi> that had he been habited like him, the reſemblance both in Perſon, Countenance, and Voice was ſo great, that it would have been difficult to know them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funder. Hereof too <hi>Dorimachus</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: Who, on occaſion, treating the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenians</hi> after his inſolent and menacing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Sciron</hi> a little tranſported; <hi>How now</hi> Babyrtas, ſaith he, <hi>do you think that you or your Threats can awe the</hi> Meſſenians? To this Affront <hi>Dorimachus</hi> made no Reply, and not able now otherwiſe to avoid it, yielded that the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> ſhould purſue the Reparation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61906:272"/>of the Injuries that had been done them, and the Puniſhment of thoſe who were ſound Guilty. But he was no ſooner return'd to his Country, when this Ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rage they had done him, ſo wrought in his Mind that without any other known Motive, he prevail'd with the <hi>Aetolians</hi> to make War on the <hi>Meſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſton</hi> was at that time Praetor of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolians;</hi> whoſe Infirmities did not permit him to be at the Head of their Army; to him <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimachus</hi> was ally'd, as likewiſe one <hi>Scopas;</hi> to <hi>Dorimachus</hi> then he committed, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the intire Execution of his Authority; who nevertheleſs did not adventure in their Publick Aſſemblies to perſuade them to this War with the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> not being furniſh'd with Matter ſufficient to determine them to ſuch a Reſolution; and he knew moreover, that his meaning would be too well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and that his Revenge and his Profit were the true Motives to ſuch Counſels. So that forbearing to preſs it publickly, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd to win <hi>Scopas</hi> to aſſiſt him in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt the <hi>Meſſenians.</hi> Telling him, there was nothing to be feared from the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> while the Authority was in ſuch raw hands; <hi>Philip</hi> not having attain'd the Age of Seventeen Years; he further added, that the <hi>Eleans</hi> were the <hi>Aetolians</hi> faſt Friends, and in Alliance with them, and concluded there could be no hazard from thence, in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61906:273"/>breaking the Peace with the <hi>Meſſenians.</hi> But the Argument that weigh'd moſt with <hi>Scopas,</hi> as an <hi>Aetolian,</hi> was the great Profit and Plunder that would ariſe thereby. For that their Country was rich, naked, and unguarded, and might be eaſily ſurpriz'd; and in a word, he promis'd himſelf greater Advantage by how much that in the <hi>Cleomenic</hi> War, that Territory alone had eſcap'd the Rapine and Violence of the Soldiers; and had felt none of thoſe Evils of War by which the whole Country beſide had been waſted. He further, and above all things, endeavour'd to perſuade him, that nothing could fall out more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> And for what could happen with reſpect to the <hi>Achaians,</hi> if they ſhould chance to oppoſe their march, they could have no juſt ſubject of Complaint, while they did no other than barely repel Force by Force; and in caſe they attempted nothing, that then the execution of what they had projected would be ſo much the more feaſible. That after all that had been ſaid, there were not wanting fair Pretexts to take up Arms againſt the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> who had long given occaſion enough, by their entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Security to the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Achaians,</hi> to take part with them in all their Enterprizes. Thus he prevail'd with <hi>Scopas,</hi> and his Friends, and wrought ſo far upon them, that without attending the Reſolution of a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> or ſo much as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61906:273"/>their Purpoſe to the Magiſtrates in being; or making any one ſtep according to ancient Cuſtom; they did at once, and of their own Heads, in effect, declare War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Meſſenians, Epirots, Achaians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnanians,</hi> and <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſame time they ſent out their Fleet of Pilſerers to infeſt the adjacent Seas; who meeting with a Ship of the Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> off of <hi>Cythera,</hi> made Prize of her, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her into Port, ſold both the Ship and her Company. In ſhort, they proceeded to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all along the Coaſt of <hi>Epirus,</hi> imploying for that ſervice Veſſels of <hi>Cephallania,</hi> and made an attempt on <hi>Thyrea,</hi> a Town of <hi>Acar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nania.</hi> Afterwards diſpatching Troops by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ways into <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> they ſurpriz'd and kept poſſeſſion of a Fortreſs call'd <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> in the heart of the <hi>Megalopolitan</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; which they made uſe of for a Retreat, and place of Refuge, and to lodge and ſecure their Plunder: But ſome time after they loſt it again to <hi>Timoxenus,</hi> Praetor of the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>Taurion;</hi> who had been left by <hi>Antigonus</hi> on his departure out of <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſus,</hi> to adminiſter the Affairs of the Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> in thoſe Parts. For <hi>Antigonus</hi> was in poſſeſſion of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which he took and held by the conſent of the <hi>Achains,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> and had not reſtor'd <hi>Orchomenus,</hi> which be had taken by force, but on the contrary kept it ſtill in his Hands,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61906:274"/>and held it for his own. His Motive it may be preſum'd for ſo doing, being not only to preſerve by that means, an eaſie ingreſs into <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> but to be able by keeping a Gariſon in <hi>Orchomenus</hi> to ſecure and awe the neighbouring Territory to better Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorimachus</hi> and <hi>Scopas</hi> then chuſing their time, when the Praetor <hi>Timoxenus</hi> was upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning up his Charge, and <hi>Aratus</hi> who was to ſucceed him not yet inveſted in the Authority, call'd an Aſſembly of the <hi>Aetolians</hi> in <hi>Rhium,</hi> and having given their Orders to have the <hi>Cephallenian</hi> Veſſels in a readineſs, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd their Troops, and tranſported them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> taking their march towards <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and paſſing through the Territories of <hi>Patroe, Pharoe,</hi> and <hi>Tritoea,</hi> they made ſhow to the <hi>Achaians</hi> of having no deſign to moleſt them in their Paſſage. Howbeit the covetous Soldiers withheld not their Hands, but plunder'd and ſpoil'd the Country every where as they went, till they came to <hi>Phiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea.</hi> This Town they made their place of Arms, and the Seat of the War, and from hence made their Inroads on the Lands of the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> without any regard to the right of Nations, and the ancient Friendſhip and Alliance that had been made and continu'd between them; but led by their Avarice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Rules of Honour or Equity, robb'd and ſpoil'd the Country with impunity, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61906:274"/>
                        <hi>Meſſenians</hi> not finding themſelves of ſtrength ſufficient to adventure out againſt them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Achaians,</hi> in the mean time, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Cuſtom, aſſembled at <hi>Aegium,</hi> where the <hi>Patroeans</hi> and <hi>Pharoeans</hi> preſerr'd their Complaints of the Damages that had been done them by the <hi>Aetolians</hi> in their march through their Country. The <hi>Meſſenians</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe complained of their Outrages and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Dealing, and ſent their Deputies to pray ſpeedy Succours. After the Aſſembly had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated on theſe Matters, it was concluded, That the reſentment of thoſe of <hi>Patroe</hi> and <hi>Pharoe</hi> was juſt, and ought to be proſecuted; and that the caſe of the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> was to be commiſerated: And it was eſpecially agreed, That the State in general had been affronted by this inſolent proceeding of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who had preſum'd in hoſtile manner to enter upon <hi>Achaia,</hi> not only without their permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but againſt the Treaty of Peace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, juſtly provok'd by theſe Infractions, they reſolv'd to ſend Succours to the <hi>Meſſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and that as ſoon as the Praetor ſhould have put them in Arms, they would then proceed further to execute what ſhould be thought expedient by the Aſſembly. <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xenus,</hi> who was yet in the Praetorſhip, was not very well pleaſed with the Expodition, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> conſequently with the Decree of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; for his Authority being not yet expir'd, he had no mind to the Command, as having
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61906:275"/>but a doubtful Opinion of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, which had been long unexercis'd in Arms. For after the expulſion of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> weary of former Wars, and believing the preſent peaceable poſture of their Affairs was likely to endure, had totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh'd the Trade of Warfare, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the uſe of Arms. But <hi>Aratus</hi> provok'd at the Indignities they had ſuffer'd by the audacious <hi>Aetolians,</hi> purſu'd the matter with another Spirit; nor was this the firſt occaſion he had conveiv'd of averſion to that People. Wherefore he loſt no time in putting the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians</hi> under Arms, but determin'd to come ſpeedily to a Battel with the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> In a word, five Days before he was to enter on his Charge, (<hi>Timoxenus</hi> delivering up the Seal) he diſpatch'd his Orders to all the Towns and Cities, aſſigning them a Day when all their young Men, fit to carry Arms, ſhould aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> And here we have thought it a Debt due to the Merit of <hi>Aratus</hi> to ſay ſomething of him in particular.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aratus</hi> was endu'd with almoſt all the good Qualities, that could be wiſh'd, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Man for great and publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: He was able in the Art of Perſuaſion; conceiv'd rightly, and readily executed; and when it was prudent to be ſilent, he very well knew how to hold his peace. He had not his Equal in ſupporting with conſtancy the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions of his fellow Citizens; ſecond to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61906:275"/>none in compoſing them, and artful in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Friends and Confederates. He was ſubtile to contrive and conceal his ſecret Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and none better at deviſing Stratagems, and laying Ambuſhes againſt an Enemy. And in a word, he compaſs'd the moſt difficult En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes by Patience and Application: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of manifold Inſtances may be enumerated; namely and principally, his ſurprizing of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon</hi> and <hi>Mantinoea;</hi> his expelling the <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> out of <hi>Pellene;</hi> and his getting poſſeſſion of <hi>Acro Corinth</hi> by intelligence. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, it is as true, that at the Head of an Army in the Field he was quite another Man; for as he was too ſlow in his Reſolutions, ſo was he too backward in Danger; and wanted aſſurance to look on any Attempt, that bore the leaſt appearance of Terrour; which were defects that gave occaſion of great advantage to the Enemy, who ſpoil'd and pillag'd the whole Country of <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> and coming once to know his unguarded part, they never fail'd of ſucceeding when they attack'd him there. So true it is that Nature hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diverſify'd Men in their Bodies and Minds; but triumphs in diſſimilitude of Mind in one and the ſame Man, who will be found not only capable and inſufficient in things that are divers, but in the ſelf-ſame things; we ſhall ſee him Wiſe and Weak; Brave and a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard by fits. Nor is there any thing new in what we remark on this Subject; or remote
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61906:276"/>from common Obſervation and Experience, if we but conſider with attention. Some Men in heat of the Chace will boldly attack a wild Beaſt, and do as bravely in ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, yet cannot endure the dangers of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and are not to be truſted in any Solemn Occaſion in the Field. Thus the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Horſe are not to be broken or reſiſted, when form'd into a Body in a Line of Battel; but ſingly and Man to Man they are but a ſlight People. The contrary whereof is found of the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> The <hi>Candiots</hi> are wonderful in their way, by Sea and Land; their Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Ambuſhes, Piracies, Surprizes, attempts by Night, and beating up of Quarters; and, in ſhort, in every thing that requires Subtilty and Addreſs, wherein they are ſuperiour to all others: But in a pitch'd Field, they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be brought to look an Enemy in the Face. While it is found quite otherwiſe with the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have taken occaſion of this Digreſſion, to the end the Credit of our Hiſtory may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo no blemiſh with the Reader, when he ſhall chance to find the Characters of the ſame Men ſo inconſiſtent with themſelves, and ſee them acting different Parts on the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. After the <hi>Achaians,</hi> purſuant to the Decree, had aſſembled all their able Men for the Service of the War; the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Supplications by their Deputies, that they might not be abandon'd to the Mercy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61906:276"/>of the Enemy, and declar'd their willingneſs to be admitted into the League; but the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Miniſters demurr'd to the receiving them into the Confederacy, without the Concurrence firſt obtain'd of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and the reſt of the Allies. For the general Treaty that was made by the procurement of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> between the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians, Epirots, Phocians,</hi> and <hi>Macedonians, Boeotians, Arcadians,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalians;</hi> had been continu'd yet without infraction. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> had leave to hope, that as ſoon as their Troops were form'd, a ſupply of Succours ſhould be given them; on condition they ſent the Sons of their Principal Citizens to be kept as Hoſtages at <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> whereby to give Security to the Allies, that they ſhould not come to any Accord with the <hi>Aetolians</hi> without their Concurrence. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were at this time with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on the Frontiers of the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> purſuant to the Conditions of the Treaty, but in effect more to obſerve from thence the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of theſe Agitations, than to act the part of honeſt Allies. And now the Affairs of the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> being concluded, <hi>Aratus</hi> ſent to the <hi>Aetolians</hi> to let them know what had been determin'd; to require them to depart out of the Territory of <hi>Meſſenia,</hi> and not to march into <hi>Achaia</hi> on peril of being treated as Enemies. When <hi>Scopas</hi> and <hi>Dorimachus</hi> had receiv'd this Reſolution of the <hi>Achaians,</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61906:277"/>and underſtood they were now in Arms, and drawn together at the place of Rendezvous; they concluded together, that it was their beſt courſe to yield to their Demands, and thereupon diſpatch'd Meſſengers to <hi>Cyllene,</hi> and to <hi>Ariſton</hi> the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Praetor, deſiring them to take up all the Merchant Veſſels they could procure in thoſe parts, and ſend them with expedition to the Iſland of <hi>Phlias,</hi> where they were to attend further Orders. In the mean time the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Army (two days after) took their march with their Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, taking their way towards the <hi>Eleans.</hi> For with that People they had preſerv'd a faſt Friendſhip, thereby to keep their Paſſage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to invade and ſpoil the <hi>Peloponneſians. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> confiding too eaſily on the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> ſo quickly executing what they ſeem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, diſmiſs'd the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and march'd himſelf towards <hi>Patroea</hi> with only three Thouſand Foot and three Hundred Horſe; to whom were joyn'd the Troops of <hi>Taurion. Dorimachus</hi> and <hi>Scopas</hi> receiving intelligence in the mean time that <hi>Aratus</hi> was in their Neighbourhood with an Army, and fearing leſt they ſhould be attack'd at their Embarking, and being well enough diſpos'd to have the War continue; diſpatch'd away their Booty to the Fleet under a good Guard, with Orders to make Sail to <hi>Rhium</hi> with their Cargo, and there to attend, as if it had been their purpoſe to Embark there.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61906:277"/>When they themſelves, after they had a while march'd after their Plunder, the better to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it; and obſerving every where as they went the diſpoſition of the Country, turn'd off and march'd towards <hi>Olympia.</hi> As ſoon as they had the news of <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Taurion</hi>'s being in the Territory of <hi>Clitoria,</hi> with the Troops we mention'd, they then concluded they ſhould not be able to Embark at <hi>Rhium</hi> without Danger or a Battel: And therefore were of Opinion, that their beſt courſe was to endeavour to come to Action as ſoon as they could, before the Enemy ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforc'd with more Troops; and while they continu'd ſecure, and without any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſurprize. For they reckon'd that if they could be able to put them into the leaſt diſorder, they ſhould then compaſs their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat without difficulty, with the Spoils and Plunder they had taken; and before the States of <hi>Aetolia</hi> could come to the Aſſembly; or in caſe the Enemy, terrify'd with the ſuddenneſs of the Attempt, ſhould refuſe Battel, they ſhould then likewiſe not fail of gaining their Paſſage according to their own deſire. With theſe Thoughts they held on their march till they arriv'd near <hi>Methydrium,</hi> in the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> where they incamp'd.</p>
                     <p>And now albeit the <hi>Achaian</hi> Generals were well aware of the Enemies approach; yet they conducted their Affairs with ſo little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, that they may be ſaid to have neglected
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61906:278"/>no one thing that might avail to perfect the Character of Folly and Inſufficiency. For, in ſhort, as ſoon as they had quitted the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the <hi>Clitorians,</hi> they came and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd near <hi>Caphya;</hi> and when the Enemy on their moving from <hi>Methydrium,</hi> took their March by <hi>Orchomenus,</hi> the <hi>Achaians</hi> drew out and appear'd in Battel in the Fields of <hi>Caphya;</hi> being defended on one ſide by the River that runs through that Country. After the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> had well conſider'd the Ground; that the Enemy was advantageouſly poſted; that they had cut many. Trenches along the Bank of the River, whereby it was hardly any where paſſable; and after they had farther remark'd a ſtrong deſire in them to come to Blows; they upon deliberate Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it their ſafeſt courſe to avoid a Battel; contrary to their firſt Determination; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing therefore in good Order, they march'd on, taking their way towards <hi>Oligyrtus,</hi> keeping the high Grounds: And thought they ſhould gain a great Point at that time, if they could compaſs their Paſſage without moleſtation, or being oblig'd to give the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Battel. After <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Taurion</hi> had ſtaid till they ſaw the Van of the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Army to have now gain'd the Hills; and the Horſe in the Plains bringing up and ſuſtaining the Rear; and who now drew near an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence call'd <hi>Propus:</hi> They ſent out their Horſe after them, to whom they joyn'd their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61906:278"/>light-arm'd Troops under the leading of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi> the <hi>Acarnanian;</hi> theſe had order to fall on their Rear-guard to make ſome proof of the mettle of the Enemy. Now, if it were reaſonable to come to a Battel, they could not have made a worſe choice than to attack the Enemy in the Rear, for their Groſs had already paſs'd the Plains; but to have done as they ought, would have been to have ingag'd their Van, as ſoon as they had enter'd on the Champaign Ground. In which caſe they had had the benefit of fighting with the Advantage, both in the nature of their Arms, and the ſtrength of their Order, wherein in plain Ground they were in both ſuperior to the Enemy, who could not poſſibly have then fought without great odds againſt them. But while they committed this over-ſight, and attack'd not the <hi>Aetolians</hi> till they had gain'd the Advantage of Ground, it was no wonder that the Succeſs fell out accordingly. For the light-arm'd Troops no ſooner came to the Charge, when the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Horſe had gain'd the Mountain, firm and in good order, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good round march, whereby to come up and Joyn their Foot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aratus,</hi> who could not very well diſcover how the Affair went, and not rightly judging of the Danger to which he was going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf; imagining the Enemies haſty Motion to be no other than Flight, detach'd his <hi>Curiaſſiers</hi> from the Wings, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61906:279"/>them to advance to the Charge, to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force and ſuſtain the light-arm'd Soldiers. In the mean time drawing up the reſt of his Troops into one Battalion, he march'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Head of them, and haſtily advanc'd towards the Enemy; doing every thing with precipitation. But the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Horſe had no ſooner paſs'd the Plain, and joyn'd the Foot who had the Rear-guard, and had now gain'd the Mountain; when they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a halt, and ordering their Foot on the Flanks, incourag'd one another to fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: And now facing about, the Shouts they made caus'd thoſe who were at a diſtance to return and haſten to their aſſiſtance; ſo that their number increaſing, in confidence of their ſuperiour Strength, and the benefit of charging from higher Ground, they boldly attack'd the Enemies Horſe, and their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd Troops, and after a long and obſtinate Diſpute the <hi>Achaians</hi> were worſted: Who flying, ſo terrify'd thoſe who were coming in no very good order to their Relief, that they likewiſe retreated as faſt as they came; partly out of ignorance of the ſtate of the Battel, partly by meeting thoſe of their Party, who were flying for Safety from the Enemy. This was the reaſon why it came to paſs, that this Party only of five Hundred of their Men was beaten; and above two Thouſand betook themſelves to flight without ingaging. And now the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who took Counſel of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61906:279"/>preſent poſture of the Field, follow'd them hard in the Rear with great Shouts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. In ſhort, while the <hi>Achaian</hi> Troops were retreating back to the Groſs, as they thought of the Army, which they hop'd would afford them a ſafe reception; their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat was Soldier-like, in good and ſafe order; but as ſoon as they perceiv'd them to have quitted the advantageous Poſt they had taken; that their Order was broken and confus'd; marching in a Defileé, then they ſell into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion likewiſe, and ſcattering and diſperſing themſelves here and there, ſome got into neighbouring Towns, others meeting a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion of their own Troops, that advanc'd to their Succour, ſo terrify'd each other, tho' no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy were near, that they both broke and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd. Of thoſe that ſhifted for themſelves, as we obſerv'd, ſome got into the Towns round about, and a good Party eſcap'd to <hi>Orchome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Caphya,</hi> which were not far off. For had they not had thoſe ſafe Retreats at hand, they had been intirely ruin'd.</p>
                     <p>Thus have we related the Story of this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which was fought near <hi>Caphya.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were encamp'd in the Territory of <hi>Methydrium,</hi> they drew their whole Forces together, and march'd to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Achaians;</hi> but they arriv'd not till the Day after the Battel, and their coming prov'd of no other uſe, than to take
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61906:280"/>care of burying the dead Bodies of thoſe with whom they expected to have joyn'd, and hop'd to have reliev'd. So that digging a great Ditch in the Territory of the <hi>Caphyans,</hi> they there bury'd the dead, performing the Obſequies of thoſe unfortunate Men with great Honour and Solemnity. And now the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> having obtain'd a Victory ſo contrary to their Hopes, by the ſingle ſervice of their Horſe, and light-arm'd Soldiers, took their march thereupon, without fear or danger, quite croſs the Country of <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> And after making an attempt on <hi>Pellene,</hi> and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing the Territory of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> they took their way by the <hi>Iſthmus.</hi> Theſe matters then which we have now related were the cauſe of the Confederate War; and the Decree that was conceiv'd thereupon, and confirm'd in a general Aſſembly of the Allies at <hi>Corinth;</hi> (where King <hi>Philip,</hi> who procur'd the ſame, and was preſent) was the beginning of the ſaid War.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Achaians</hi> ſoon after this Defeat call an Aſſembly; where <hi>Aratus</hi> was ſeverely proſecuted with Complaints on all hands: As having been manifeſtly the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the loſs and diſhonour they had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd. And by how much his Enemies preſs'd him with Accuſations, and with ſtrong Reaſons laid open his miſmanagement; by ſo much did the Hatred and Indignation of the People increaſe againſt him. Firſt, there was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61906:280"/>no diſpute but that <hi>Aratus</hi> had greatly err'd; in having, as one may ſay, uſurp'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, by taking it upon him before he was regularly elected into his Charge: And he could not deny, but that what he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd thereupon had very ill ſucceeded. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore they blam'd him, for that ſeeing the <hi>Aetolians</hi> yet in the heart of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> he had been prevail'd with to diſmiſs the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaian</hi> Troops, notwithſtanding he had been before well aſſur'd that <hi>Scopas</hi> and <hi>Dorimachus</hi> were ſirmly determin'd to embroil their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and to do all they could to ingage them in a War. The third Article againſt him was, His adventuring to ingage with ſo few Troops, when he might with eaſe have made a good Retreat to the neighbouring Towns, where he might at leiſure have reinforc'd his Army; and then given the Enemy Battel, if he had ſeen cauſe. The laſt and heavieſt Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him was, That after he had reſolv'd to give the Enemy Battel, he did not make one Soldier-like ſtep in the whole Conduct of the Action. For it had been in his choice to have ſought on plain Ground, which would have been much to his advantage; for there the heavy-arm'd Troops could have ingag'd, from whoſe ſervice he could hardly have ſail'd of Succeſs: While on the contrary he choſe to fight on the skirts of the Hills, where his light-arm'd Soldiers only were brought to fight, than which nothing could have been
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61906:281"/>contriv'd more to the advantage of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But as ſoon as <hi>Aratus</hi> appear'd in the Aſſembly, and had firſt ſpoken of the many Services he had render'd the Commonwealth, he then reply'd to the Reproaches that had been utter'd againſt him. And made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the loſs they had ſuſtain'd was not through his Default; nevertheleſs he beſought their Pardon; if he had been found wanting in any thing in that occaſion; and pray'd they would not cenſure him with more Rigour than Humanity. In ſhort, he ſo wrought with the People, that they grew inrag'd againſt thoſe who had ſo violently proſecuted him, and it was long e'er they forgave them; and in the mean time renewing their good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Aratus,</hi> they gave themſelves intirely up to his Counſel and Conduct, in all their future Enterprizes. Theſe things came to paſs, in the hundred and forty ninth Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad: While what we have now further to deliver, happen'd during that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſembly then proceeded to decree, That Ambaſſadors ſhould be diſpatch'd to the <hi>Epirots, Boeotians, Acarnanians,</hi> and to King <hi>Philip;</hi> to remonſtrate to them that the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolians</hi> having now the ſecond time violated the general Treaty, had in Hoſtile manner invaded <hi>Achaia;</hi> and further to demand Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours according to the Covenants of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to move that the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> might
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61906:281"/>be taken into the Confederacy. Moreover, they decreed, That their Praetor ſhould raiſe an Army of five Thouſand Foot, and five Hundred Horſe; that he ſhould march to the Relief of the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Aetolians</hi> ſhould return to Invade them: And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, came to a determination with the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Horſe and Foot which they were to furniſh reſpectively toward the Forces that were to be rais'd for the general Service of the War. Theſe things being concluded, the <hi>Achaians</hi> (who could not forget their late diſgrace) would not abandon the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> nor the Enterprize they had projected. The Ambaſſadors therefore acquitted themſelves of their Commiſſion. The Praetor levied Troops among the <hi>Achaians,</hi> purſuant to the Decree of the States, and concluded with the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemonians</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> that they ſhould each of them bring into the Field two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five Hundred Foot, and two Hundred and Fifty Horſe; to the end they might have an Army on foot to anſwer any preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, conſiſting of ten Thouſand Foot and a Thouſand Horſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Aetolians</hi> in the mean time were not wanting to themſelves, who (the day of their aſſembly now approaching) reſolv'd to do their beſt to deal with the Confederates of the <hi>Achaians;</hi> and not only to endeavour a Peace with the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and the Allies, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61906:282"/>even with the <hi>Achaians</hi> themſelves, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they would exclude the <hi>Meſſenians;</hi> and came to a Reſolution, That in caſe they would not abandon them, that then War ſhould be declar'd againſt them; than which nothing could be a more manifeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. For being themſelves in League with the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> they denounc'd War againſt thoſe in caſe they held Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the others; and on the contrary would enter into Friendſhip with the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> provided they would become Enemies to the <hi>Meſſenians.</hi> But they made no difficulty to act ſuch irregular Parts as theſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Epirots</hi> and King <hi>Philip,</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the caſe of the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> yielded to their being receiv'd into the Confederacy. And while they condemn'd the Proceedings of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> they were not ſurpriz'd at the Relation; it being nothing new or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of that People. They concluded however to give no further Proofs of their Reſentment, but reſolv'd to continue at Peace with them. So much eaſier it is to paſs by the Injuries done by thoſe who have by a cuſtom of tranſgreſſing taught us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, than of ſuch as take us by ſurprize, and from whom we could not have expected foul play.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who were held for the common Outlaws and Robbers of <hi>Greece,</hi> and whoſe manner it was to ſtrike without warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61906:282"/>and make War without any previous or publick declaration, diſdain'd to make any Apology for their Doings to thoſe who had charg'd them with their injurious Dealing: On the contrary, they treated their Accuſers with mockery and contempt. As to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who tho' they had been but lately reſcu'd from the Tyranny of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> by the Favour of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the Affection of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> nevertheleſs forgetting what they ow'd for that good Office, and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances they had given to King <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to enter into no Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prejudicial to the Intereſts of the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> they ſecretly, notwithſtanding ſent their Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and became their Confederates.</p>
                     <p>And now when the <hi>Achaians</hi> had form'd an Army of their ableſt Men, and the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemonians</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians</hi> had promis'd to bring in their <hi>quota</hi> of Succours, behold a Naval Army arrives, conſiſting of Ninety Sail of Ships from <hi>Illyria,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Scerdilaidas</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Pharus;</hi> who paſſing by the Iſland, which was the Bounds preſcrib'd by the Treaty with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> made their firſt deſcent near <hi>Pylus,</hi> which they attack'd, and after many fruitleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were repuls'd. Afterwards <hi>Demetrius</hi> with a Fleet of fourſcore Sail proceeded as far as the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> where he got Money from ſome, and plunder'd others of thoſe Iſlands.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61906:283"/>As to <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> he made Sail directly for the Coaſt of <hi>Illyria,</hi> and came to <hi>Naupactus</hi> with a Fleet of forty Ships, favour'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by <hi>Amina</hi> King of the <hi>Athamenes,</hi> with whom he was in Alliance. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the procurement of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into Conditions touching the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Plunder, he ingag'd to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Achaians.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Ageſilaus, Dorimachus</hi> and <hi>Scopas</hi> had finiſh'd this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> and had given him the Town of <hi>Cynoetha</hi> for Caution, they march'd with the <hi>Illyrians</hi> into <hi>Achaia,</hi> the <hi>Aetolians</hi> being at the Head of an Army as good as they could poſſibly raiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſton</hi> Praetor of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> during theſe Agitations, remain'd at home, not only without acting in any thing, but ſeeming ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all that was done, profeſs'd to be in Amity with the <hi>Achaians;</hi> wherein he ſhew'd himſelf a weak Man, and a ſlight Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. For which way could he hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal by words, what was made by deeds ſo publick and notorious? But in ſhort, he was held by all the World for one of little worth. <hi>Dorimachus,</hi> taking his march through the Territory of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> came to <hi>Cynaetha.</hi> The Inhabitants of this Town, who are of <hi>Arcadian</hi> Extraction, had been long vex'd with civil Diſſentions; and had expreſs'd their hatred one to another by Murders, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all kinds of Violence: And had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61906:283"/>come to a Reſolution of making a Diviſion once again of their Lands; and, in ſhort, the Faction that favour'd the <hi>Achaians</hi> being at that time uppermoſt, the Power was in their hands; and the Governour himſelf was an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaian.</hi> This being the Poſture of Affairs in that Town, thoſe who were under ſentence of Buniſhment, had a little before the arrival of the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Army, labour'd about a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and beſought the Government, that they might be reſtor'd to their Country. Upon which Overtures the Citizens were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with to yield to their admittance; but to the end they might not tranſact any thing without the concurrence of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> they firſt diſpatch'd their Deputies to them, to obtain their Approbation. The <hi>Achaians</hi> readily accorded to the requeſt of the baniſh'd Perſons, conceiving they ſhould thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate themſelves and gain the good will of both Parties; of thoſe in whoſe Hands the Magiſtracy was then lodg'd, for their greateſt hopes was in the <hi>Achaians;</hi> and of the others who were reſtor'd to their Country, as owing the benefit to their Favour. So that theſe Differences being compos'd, the <hi>Cynoethians</hi> diſmiſs'd their Gariſon and their Governour, and being now reconcil'd to their Exiles, who were to the number of about three Hundred, receiv'd them to their Friendſhip; who gave them all the evidences of Fidelity and fair Dealing, that could poſſibly be interchang'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61906:284"/>between People firmly diſpos'd to love and oblige one another. But without the leaſt appearance of any new Motive of Diſſention, they were no ſooner receiv'd into the Town, when they conſpir'd together to betray their Country, and deſtroy thoſe who but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had been the Authors of ſo great a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. So that it may be ſaid, That while they were proteſting Fidelity by the Victims on the Altar, they were meditating the moſt horrible Crime, that could be conceiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God or Man. For they had ſcarce made an end of ſwearing Fidelity on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiv'd into the Town, when they call'd in the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and deliver'd it into their Hands, proud of being the Authors of their Countries ruine, that had given them Being, and of inſlaving thoſe who had redeem'd them.</p>
                     <p>Behold the manner how this piece of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery was contriv'd. Some of the Exiles had been <hi>Polymarchs</hi> (that is) they had been in command in the Army: Which ſort of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates (it ſeems) had a right to take charge of the Gates of the Town; had the cuſtody of the Keys, and by Night the Command of the Guard. Now the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who were not far off, having Ladders and all proper Proviſion with them, lay conceal'd waiting the occaſion, when the <hi>Polymarchs,</hi> who had been baniſh'd (after having diſpatch'd their Companions of the Guard, who were not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61906:284"/>partakers of the Villany) preſently threw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Gates. Whereupon one Party of the <hi>Aetolians</hi> enter'd that way, and another ſcal'd the Walls. In the mean time, the Inhabitants, terrify'd at an attempt ſo ſurprizing, were confounded in their Judgments what to do, or which way firſt to go; for, in ſhort, they no ſooner advanc'd againſt thoſe who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by the Gate, when they were alarm'd by the others who were ſcaling their Walls; but thoſe who enter'd by the Gate being the greater number, found them more than work enough. So that in the end the <hi>Aetolians</hi> became Maſters of the Place, and amidſt the many Crimes they committed, perform'd this one act of Juſtice, namely, to cut thoſe in pieces firſt, who had betray'd the Town into their Hands; making Booty of their Goods. Howbeit the reſt afterwards far'd no better, their Houſes being expos'd to Plunder, and many of the Inhabitants put to Torment, on ſuſpicion they might have conceal'd their Goods of greateſt value. After this ſevere treatment of the <hi>Cynoethians,</hi> they plac'd a Garriſon in the Town, and march'd with their Army towards <hi>Luſſi,</hi> when arriving near a Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> between <hi>Clytoria</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noetha,</hi> a place of great Devotion, and a Sanctuary among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to rob the Goddeſs of the ſacred Cattel, and all that was near the Temple. But to prevent this Violence, and with-hold them
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61906:285"/>from greater Crimes, the <hi>Luſſiatoe</hi> freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd part of what appertain'd to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs upon them. Whereupon they diſlodg'd from thence, and went and encamp'd before <hi>Clytoria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Aratus,</hi> Praetor of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> having ſent to demand Aids of King <hi>Philip,</hi> proceeded to make extraordinary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies of Men, and call'd on the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians</hi> for the Succours they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to contribute, purſuant to the Treaty. The <hi>Aetolians</hi> likewiſe preſs'd the <hi>Clytorians</hi> to renounce their Alliance with the <hi>Achaians,</hi> and take part with them. Which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, they endeavour'd to reduce them by force, ſcaling the Walls of the Town. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolutely oppos'd by the Inhabitants, they were compell'd to retire. From thence they return'd to <hi>Cynaetha,</hi> pillaging the Country all about, and carrying away the ſacred Cattel of the Goddeſs. Then they propos'd to put the Town into the hands of the <hi>Eleans;</hi> which not being accepted, they reſolv'd to keep it for themſelves, putting in <hi>Euripides</hi> for their Governour. But ſhortly after being allarm'd, at the news of the approach of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> they burnt the Town, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd; taking their march towards <hi>Rhium,</hi> with purpoſe to paſs that way into <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi>

                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Taurion</hi> having notice of the Succeſs of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and of what they had done at <hi>Cynaetha,</hi> and hearing that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> of <hi>Pharus</hi> was arriv'd from the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clades</hi> to <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> he importun'd him to come to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Achaians;</hi> to draw his Veſſels over the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and fall on the <hi>Aetolians</hi> in their paſſage. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who had fled from the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> that were in purſuit of him, and had brought with him no leſs Shame than Plunder from the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> readily yielded to the Demand; eſpecially in regard <hi>Taurion</hi> was to be at the expence of tranſporting over the Veſſels. But that Work was no ſooner over, when they underſtood that the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had gain'd their Paſſage two Days before; whereupon <hi>Demetrius,</hi> contenting himſelf to make Inroads on them here and there, near the Sea-coaſt, retir'd to the Port of <hi>Corinth.</hi> In concluſion, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemonians,</hi> induſtriouſly and with evil intent, deferr'd ſending thoſe Aids, to which by the accord they were oblig'd; covering their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Purpoſe, however, with diſpatching an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Supply of Horſe and Foot. While the <hi>Achaian</hi> Troops rendezvous'd about <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who in ſhort govern'd his Affairs in ſuch ſort in that occaſion, as render'd him rather a cautious and wiſe Citizen, than an able Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of an Army. For indeed the reflection on his late Diſaſters had ſo warn'd him, that he remain'd long undetermin'd how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61906:286"/>till at length <hi>Dorimachus</hi> and <hi>Scopas,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leiſure given them to act the Part for which they came, return'd home without moleſtation: While <hi>Aratus</hi> in the mean time well knew, they muſt of neceſſity take their March by ſuch Ways and Paſſes, ſo difficult and dangerous, that as one may ſay, they might have been beaten by the Sound only of a Trumpet. As for the <hi>Cynaethians,</hi> tho' their uſage from the <hi>Aetolians</hi> was barbarous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet ſo it was that all the World look'd on their Misfortunes as a Puniſhment juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as the <hi>Arcadians</hi> are in ſome Reputation for Vertue among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> not only for their laudable Manners, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity wherewith Strangers and all People are receiv'd among them; but chiefly for their Devotion to the Gods; it will not therefore be amiſs, that we give ſome account of the Brutality of the <hi>Cynaethians,</hi> and how it came to paſs that being of <hi>Arcadian</hi> Extraction, they ſhould have ſo degenerated, as to ſurpaſs in all ſorts of Crimes and Barbarities the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Nation beſide. For my own part, I am apt to conclude, that this their Depravity ſprang from their being the firſt and almoſt only People among the <hi>Arcadians</hi> that apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatiz'd, and renounc'd the wholeſom and wiſe Inſtitutions of their Forefathers; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and natural Ties of Humanity, ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd by all the <hi>Arcadians</hi> beſide. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61906:286"/>is eſteem'd uſeful every-where, but to the <hi>Arcadians</hi> it is neceſſary; I mean the true Myſtery and Science of Muſick. And no Credit is to be given to a Saying of <hi>Ephorus,</hi> ſo unworthy of the Author, who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Writings tells us, <hi>That Muſick was invented to deceive and abuſe us.</hi> Nor is there any ground to conclude that the <hi>Cretans</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> did, without Reaſon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Uſe of the Flute and Singing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Trumpet in War: Nor that the original <hi>Arcadians</hi> did not, on ſolid Grounds, alott the Preference to Muſick, as to give it a Part in the Eſtabliſhment of their State; and whatſoever Auſterities they may otherwiſe profeſs, they make it an indiſpenſible Part of the Education of their Children, and enjoin the Study of Muſick to their Young Men till they arrive at the Age of Thirty Years, And moſt certain it is, that there is hardly any People beſide the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who in their private Families accuſtom their Children from their tendereſt Age, (and which is grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Law) to ſing Hymns to their Heroes and their Gods; every one according to the Stile and Mode of his Country. Then after their Children have been inſtructed in the Muſick of <hi>Philoxenus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> they are brought yearly to the Theatre, where they celebrate the Feaſt of <hi>Bacchus</hi> with Songs and Dances; as likewiſe the Games, call'd the <hi>Games of Childhood,</hi> as their Young Men perform thoſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61906:287"/>call'd the <hi>Games of Youth.</hi> So that all their Lifelong, they divert not themſelves ſo much in their Entertainments, and Converſation, in the Exerciſe of their Wit, as their Voices, ſinging one to another by turns. And in caſe any one ſhould profeſs himſelf ignorant of other Arts and Sciences, he may do it without reproach; but none may preſume to want Knowledge in Muſick, becauſe the the Law of the Land makes it neceſſary; nor dare they own their Inſufficiency therein, it being held infamous among that People. They are likewiſe at the Charge of the Publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in martial Dances, and to Fight and Exerciſe their Arms, according to the Cadence of Muſick, and are ſeen every Year on the Publick Theatre, to ſhew the People their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in that Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, we may ſafely conclude, That their anceſtors did not eſtabliſh this Cuſtom amongſt them, ſo much for Luxury and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as from a wiſe Conſideration of the Life they lead, and the Climate they inhabit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a People addicted to Labour, and, in a word, leading a toilſome and induſtrious Life: Which ſeems to proceed from the Inclemency of the Air, for the moſt part cold and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. For it is an eſtabliſh'd Law in Nature, that we ſhould partake of the Soil that breeds us. Nor can there be a better Reaſon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd for the Unlikeneſs of Nations, as the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Air they breathe, and the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61906:287"/>of the Countries they inhabit. And hence it comes to paſs, that the diſtance of Climates begets that diſſimilitude among us, both in Manners, Make, Humour, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Theſe gladſome Remedies then we have related, were wiſely inſtituted to cure and calm by Art the Rigours and Defects of Nature. Furthermore, they had a Cuſtom of mixing Men and Women indifferently in their Sacrifices and Publick Aſſemblies, wherein they frequently met. They likewiſe inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Quires, where the Youth of both Sexes convers'd, and ſung and danc'd together; and in a word, they left nothing unattempted, that might prevail to ſoften and ſweeten thoſe Auſterities of Nature to which the Climate had condemn'd them. And the <hi>Cynaethians,</hi> who by reaſon of their ſituation, had of all others the greateſt reaſon to preſerve theſe Cuſtoms among them (they being the moſt Northern part of all <hi>Arcadia</hi>) no ſooner fell to neglect theſe wholeſom Inſtitutions, when they fell into Diſſentions and civil Diſcords; and grew at length into ſuch depravity of Manners, that their Crimes, in number and meaſure, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd all the Nations of the <hi>Greeks</hi> beſide.</p>
                     <p>Great and manifeſt Teſtimonies were given, of the Corruption of this People's Manners, from the Averſion the <hi>Arcadians</hi> in general had conceiv'd againſt them, who, when they diſpatch'd their Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> after their Defeat, they hardly came
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61906:288"/>into any Town of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> where the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants did not warn them out again by Sound of Trumpet, and the Voice of their Publick Crier. And the People of <hi>Mantinaea</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yet farther; for they had no ſooner caus'd the <hi>Cynaethian</hi> Ambaſſadors to depart, when they cleans'd themſelves as from Infection, and ſlew Victims about their Town and Country, and offer'd Sacrifices of Purgation.</p>
                     <p>We have taken occaſion to enlarge on this Subject, to juſtifie the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Cuſtoms and Manners; and to the end leſt the <hi>Arcadians</hi> themſelves, by a wrong Judgment and Belief, that Muſick became thus familiar among them, barely for Luxury and the entertainment of idle Minds, ſhould at length fall into Contempt of that part of their own Laws and Inſtitutions. Nor are the <hi>Cynaethians</hi> themſelves without a ſhare of our Commiſeration in this Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; who, if by the Favour of Heaven, they ſhould one Day ſee an end of their Affliction, may be drawn to return to the ancient Manners of their Country; and embrace and principally cultivate this Science among them, whereby to ſoften and bend their Minds with thoſe Charms, which have power to tame wild Beaſts themſelves; than which, no way ſeems more likely to poliſh them from the Ruſt of Barbarity. But having ſpoken enough of <hi>Cynaetha,</hi> 'tis time now to return to our Buſineſs.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61906:288"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Aetolians</hi> having acted theſe Violences in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> as hath been related, return'd home without Impediment. In the interim <hi>Philip</hi> arrives at <hi>Corinth</hi> to ſuccour the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> but coming too late the occaſion was loſt; he therefore ſent his Diſpatches to the ſeveral Confederates, praying them ſpeedily to ſend their reſpective Deputies to him there, that they might deliberate together about their general Affairs. While he himſelf led his Troops towards <hi>Tegaea,</hi> on a rumour that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were fallen into civil Broils.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who had been us'd to Kingly Government, and were but newly by the power of <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſet at liberty, fell into Factions; and Seditions growing among them, they were labouring to eſtabliſh Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their State. In theſe Diſputes there were two of their <hi>Ephori,</hi> of whom it could not be diſcover'd to which Party they were inclin'd, while the other three openly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted their being of the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Faction: Conſidering King <hi>Philip</hi> as not yet of Age ripe enough to Rule the Affairs of <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> But when, contrary to their Opinion, and more ſpeedily than they expected, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were retir'd; and <hi>Philip</hi> arriv'd out of <hi>Macedon</hi> ſooner than was believ'd; the three <hi>Ephori</hi> began to fall into ſuſpicion of <hi>Adimantus,</hi> one of the other two; for they well knew he was privy to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61906:289"/>and teſtify'd his diſapproval of their Counſels; wherefore they apprehended leſt he when <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould approach nearer might reveal to him all that had paſs'd. Wherefore imparting their purpoſe to certain young Men of their Party, they proclaim'd by ſound of Trumpet, that all who were of Age to go to War, ſhould aſſemble with their Arms at a certain place of Rendezvous near the Temple of <hi>Minerva Chalciaece,</hi> to make head againſt the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were approaching their Borders. Hereupon the People aſſembled, terrify'd at this ſurprizing News; but <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus</hi> diſapproving the proceeding, haſt'ned to thoſe who were ſo drawn together, and ſpake to them after this manner: <hi>It would be wholſome Counſel to conceive ſuch Edicts, and make ſuch Proclamations, upon notice that the</hi> Aetolians <hi>our Enemies were on our Borders; but not at this time, when the</hi> Macedonians <hi>our Friends, from whoſe Bounty we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſo many good Offices, are approaching us; having their King in Perſon with them.</hi> He had no ſooner ended theſe words, when thoſe who were of Intelligence with the other <hi>Ephori</hi> fell upon him, ſtabbing him to death with their Poinyards, and together with him <hi>Sthenelaus, Alcamenes, Thyeſtes, Bionidias,</hi> and many other Principal Citizens. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes</hi> and ſome others, who foreſaw the Danger, eſcap'd to King <hi>Philip.</hi> But the <hi>Ephori,</hi> becoming by this Action formidable
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61906:289"/>in <hi>Sparta,</hi> ſent forthwith to the King, laying the cauſe of what had happen'd to the charge of thoſe who had been ſlain; praying him to deferr his coming to <hi>Sparta,</hi> till their Tumults ſhould be over, and their Affairs in a more quiet poſture: In the mean time they give him ſolemn aſſurance of fair Dealing, and that they would perform the Capitulations punctually.</p>
                     <p>Their Ambaſſadors found the King near the Mountain of <hi>Parthenia,</hi> where they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd their Commiſſion. After he had given them Audience, he told them they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and let the <hi>Ephori</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he intended to proceed on his way to <hi>Tegaea,</hi> where he deſired they would diſpatch to him proper Perſons with whom to confer touching the preſent poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. So they commiſſionated ten of the Principal Citizens of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> for that Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, appointing <hi>Onias</hi> chief of the Embaſſy.</p>
                     <p>Upon their arrival at <hi>Tegaea,</hi> they were introduc'd to the King in Council, where they renew'd their Accuſation againſt <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus;</hi> making him the Author of all thoſe Diſorders, that had happen'd among them. And, in ſhort, they made the King plauſible Promiſes to act in every thing the part of faithful Confederates, and to proceed in ſuch manner as to make it manifeſt, that they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt in Zeal and Affection thoſe whom he held for his faithfulleſt Friends. After this Diſcourſe, and more to the like effect, the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61906:290"/>Ambaſſadors withdrew. Thoſe who were preſent in the Council were divided in their Opinions; and being well aſſur'd that <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus,</hi> and thoſe who had been aſſaſſinated were ſacrific'd for their Fidelity to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> prevaricated, and were diſpos'd to enter into Alliance with the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> counſelled the King to make them an Example, and treat them as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had done the <hi>Thebans</hi> upon his coming to the Crown; But others of the graver ſort were for more moderate Counſels; remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſuch a Puniſhment was too great for their Fault; and that it would be enough to puniſh the Promoters and Heads of the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by removing them from the Magiſtracy, and placing the Authority in ſuch Hands as were firm to the Intereſt of the King.</p>
                     <p>After they had all ſpoken their Minds, the King deliver'd his Opinion; if it were true that what he ſaid in that occaſion was his own: For, in truth, it is hardly probable, that a young Prince of ſeventeen Years of Age, could be able to determine with ſuch Sagacity, in an Affair of ſo much moment. But as it is good manners in Hiſtorians, to attribute to the Princes themſelves the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that are taken in their Cabinets; ſo the Readers of Hiſtory ought to conclude, that ſuch wholſome determinations flow ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the riper Conceptions of their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, and ſuch as are admitted to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61906:290"/>Prince's Privacy. And there is all the reaſon in the World to do <hi>Aratus</hi> the juſtice of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him to be the Author of what the King deliver'd on that occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Who ſaid, That if the Confederates had any difference among themſelves, what was fitting to be done in ſuch caſe, was to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them by Word or Letter, and let them know that their Proceedings were obſerv'd: That whatſoever was done in violation of the general Alliance, ought to be puniſh'd by the joint Sentence of the Confederates: But that ſince it did not appear that the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had been guilty of any Infraction of the Union; but, on the contrary, had given the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſuch Aſſurances of their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as they did, there was no reaſon to deal ſeverely with them. That, in a word, it would not be juſt in him to animadvert on them for light Offences, whom his Father had pardon'd while they were Enemies, and he a Conqueror. This Opinion then of the King prevailing, That it would be better to connive at what had happen'd, he diſpatch'd <hi>Petraeus,</hi> one of his favourite Servants, in company of <hi>Onias,</hi> to exhort the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to continue firm to the Treaty, and to ratifie it by a new Oath, while himſelf march'd with his Army to <hi>Corinth;</hi> having given the Confederates an admirable inſtance of his Prudence and Magnanimity, in this his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi>

                     <p>The Ambaſſadors of the Confederates were already met at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where, upon the King's Arrival, they fell to deliberate with him about their common Affairs, and what reſolution to take touching the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> The <hi>Boeotians</hi> accus'd them of having in time of Peace plunder'd and violated the Temple of <hi>Minerva Itonia:</hi> The <hi>Phocians,</hi> for attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Hoſtile manner the Towns of <hi>Ambry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Daulius:</hi> The <hi>Epirots</hi> charg'd them with making Inroads and Plund'ring their Country: The <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> for their attempt on <hi>Thyreum;</hi> and after it had been made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Aſſembly, in what manner they had poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Fortreſs of <hi>Clarium,</hi> in the Dominion of the <hi>Megalopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans:</hi> That they had ruin'd the Country of <hi>Pharus</hi> and <hi>Patrae</hi> in their march, deſtroy'd <hi>Cynaetha</hi> with Fire and Sword, prophan'd the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Luſſi,</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Clytoria,</hi> made War by Sea at <hi>Pylus,</hi> and Landed in hoſtile manner on the Territory of <hi>Megalopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi> In ſhort, when all theſe Outrages of the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had been prov'd, and canvaſs'd in the Aſſembly, they accorded unanimouſly to declare War againſt them. So after they had prefac'd their Decree, with enumerating the Cauſes and Provocations of the War; it was concluded, That all thoſe who had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers by the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> ſince the Death of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Father of <hi>Philip,</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Confederacy; and that if any
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61906:291"/>by the violence of the Times had been aw'd into Obedience or Alliance with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and pay'd them Tribute, that they ſhould be forthwith ſet at liberty, the ſecurity of their reſpective Governments committed to their own hands, and no Garriſons impos'd upon them; but that they ſhould be permitted to return to their ancient Laws and Cuſtoms, free from any Tribute or Impoſitions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: That Aid ſhould be given the <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyons,</hi> in order to their re-eſtabliſhment in their Privileges, and the reſtitution of their Right to the adminiſtration of the Temple, which the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had violently wreſted from them, to make themſelves Maſters of that ſacred Place, and all the Revenues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This Decree being ordain'd in the Firſt Year of the Hundred and fortieth <hi>Olymphiad,</hi> the War of the Allies thereupon enſu'd, which was begotten by the violent and general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt proceedings of the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> And now Ambaſſadors were ſent from the Aſſembly of the States, to all the Confederate Towns, to the end the Decree being every-where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and ratifi'd by the Suffrages of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they migh jointly and ſeparately in their diſtinct States, publiſh the War againſt the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> whom King <hi>Philip</hi> likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd by his Letters, letting them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That if it were ſo, that they had juſt argument or motive whereby to indemnifie themſelves, and could fairly wipe off the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61906:292"/>that lay againſt them, that they would do well to apply themſelves to the general Aſſembly, and endeavour to put a period to ſo ſolemn a Proceſs by a Conference: That they did but make <hi>Oſtentation of their Weakneſs,</hi> by thinking they might with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity ſpoil and pillage, as they did every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, without any declar'd War, or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe for ſuch violence; and that thoſe who underwent theſe Outrages would reſt unreveng'd; or that it would be believ'd the Sufferers would be reckon'd the Aggreſſors, and Authors of the War, while they only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd themſelves to ſuch Remedies as their caſe made neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Aetolians,</hi> on the receipt of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations from King <hi>Philip,</hi> were at firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded he would not appear, and therefore prefix'd a Day for their aſſembling at <hi>Rhium;</hi> afterwards, when they heard of his arrival, they ſent to let him know, that they had not Power to determine any thing in their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, till the Convention of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral States of the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> In the mean while, the <hi>Achaians</hi> aſſembling at the uſual time, ratify'd the Decree by a general Vote of the Aſſembly, and afterwards declar'd War againſt the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> And now the King coming the <hi>Aegium,</hi> where the Diet was held, he there explain'd himſelf in many Point, and proceeded in ſuch manner, as greatly pleas'd and oblig'd the Aſſembly;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61906:292"/>where they renew'd with him the ſeveral Treaties that had been heretofore made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Anceſtors and the <hi>Achaians.</hi>

                     <p>When they diſſolv'd the Government, and ruin'd the Town of <hi>Mantinoea,</hi> they colour'd the Action by aſſerting they had done them on Injury, in tranſplanting them from one Town to a great many. But 'tis the ſumm total of Folly and Depravity, to think becauſe our Eyes are ſhut, that all the World is blind. Thus both the one and the other of theſe People, by purſuing theſe pernicious Maxims in the adminiſtration of the States, drew on themſelves many and grievous Calamities. Wherefore as well in Private Affairs as Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Negotiations, ſuch Counſels are never to be follow'd, by any who would conſult their own Good and Tranquility.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> having now come to a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with the <hi>Achaians,</hi> touching their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Affairs, return'd home with his Army, to make preparations for the War; having gain'd not only among the Confederates, but the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general, a mighty Opinion of his Goodneſs and Magnanimity, by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Decree we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Matters were tranſacted about the time that <hi>Hannibal</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General was deliberating about laying Siege to <hi>Saguntum</hi> after he had ſubdu'd all that part of <hi>Spain</hi> that lies on the other ſide of the River <hi>Eber.</hi> Since the Enterprizes of <hi>Hannibal</hi> then take begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61906:293"/>and bear data with theſe Affairs of <hi>Greece,</hi> there ſeems to be a neceſſity that we ſhould treat of them alternately, according to the Method of our preceding Book; to the end, having punctual regard to the Time, we may confront (as one may ſay) the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of both theſe People of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> But foraſmuch as thoſe of <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> were produc'd from different Cauſes, tho' they had one and the ſame event; we have therefore thought fit to handle them diſtinctly and a-part, till ſuch time as we ſhall arrive at that Period, when the Matters whereof we have made mention come to mingle, and grow to conſpire towards one and the ſame end. By which means, the beginnings and ſteps of each one reſpectively, will be made the more intelligible; and the interweaving them afterwards be leſs ſubject to confuſion, when the time of the reſpective Occurrences ſhall be adjuſted, and the Means and Cauſes of things duly ſet down. In concluſion, they will together compoſe bu one intire Hiſtory; and, in ſhort, theſe Affairs became thus min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled toward the end of that War, which was finiſh'd in the third Year of the Hundred and Fortieth Olympiad. Wherefore there will be all the reaſon in the World to treat ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matters conjointly, as thoſe that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeparately, after having firſt briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd the Memory in ſome Occurrences that fell out about thoſe times. Having propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61906:294"/>to our ſelves not only to write our Hiſtory with perſpicuity, but ſo as to engage the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's eſteem, who ſhall ſtudy it with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> paſs'd the Winter in <hi>Macedon,</hi> in making Levies and Preparations for the War, and fortifying his Frontiers againſt the Attempts of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were his near Neighbours. Afterward finding out <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> he a little too boldly conſided in, and contracted Alliance with him; and promiſing him Aids towards his acquiring certain Towns in <hi>Illyria,</hi> and cenſuring the Actions of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> (which pleas'd <hi>Scer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilaidas</hi> above all things) he eaſily won him to his purpoſe. For private Injuries have their force, and differ not from publick in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but magnitude of the Offences. And there is nothing ſo fatal to ſuch as league to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in criminal and violent Actions, as the breach of Faith among themſelves. This was experimented by the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> for it was a Stipulation between them and <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> that he ſhould ſhare a proportion in the Spoils and Plunder that ſhould be taken, who was to be a Party in the Crimes that ſhould be committed, if he would joyn wih them in their Expedition againſt the <hi>Achaians.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs on their taking and ſpoiling the City of <hi>Cynaetha,</hi> where was found great Booty of Slaves, Cattel, and other movables, they admitted him to no part thereof. Which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61906:294"/>breach of Articles ſo diſtaſted <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> that when <hi>Philip</hi> had refreſh'd the ſenſe of that Injury, he was wrought to promiſe he would enter into the common Alliance, on the terms of being paid yearly the ſumm of twenty Talents, and would make War on the <hi>Aetolians</hi> by Sea with a Fleet of thirty Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>And now the Ambaſſadors, who had been diſpatch'd to the Confederate States, firſt coming to the <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> treated with them; who frankly confirm'd the Decree, and declar'd War againſt the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> And yet tho' they ſhou'd have taken time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themſelves, and expreſs'd their juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the War, there is no People againſt whom leſs Offence could have been taken, as being Borderers on the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> and what is more, were very ill able to defend themſelves, and not long before had been deep ſufferers by <hi>Aetolian</hi> Violence.</p>
                     <p>But there is no doubt but a generous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, jealous of their Honour, prefers that to all other Conſiderations, both in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Treaties; and herein the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnanians</hi> have ſurpaſs'd moſt of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who, weak as they are, have in defence of their Reputation, ingag'd in the greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Wherefore there is no People among the <hi>Graecians</hi> with whom Friendſhip may be more ſafely contracted; there being none who profeſs more regard to publick or private Faith,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61906:295"/>or will venture further for the love of Liberty. As to the <hi>Epirots,</hi> tho' they ratify'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, yet they would not yield to declare War againſt the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> till King <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould firſt proclaim it: Wherefore they diſmiſs'd the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Ambaſſadors with promiſe to continue in good terms with them, wherein they made ſhow of very little Generoſity. Ambaſſadors were diſpatch'd in like manner to King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to diſſuade him from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any help to the <hi>Aetolians</hi> againſt King <hi>Philip,</hi> either by ſupplies of Money, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. As to the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> on whoſe ſcore the War firſt brake out; they reply'd to the Ambaſſadors, That they would not ingage in the War unleſs <hi>Phigalia,</hi> which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Frontiers, were firſt drawn off from the <hi>Aetolian</hi> League: But <hi>Oenis</hi> and <hi>Nicippus,</hi> with others who favour'd the <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd this Declaration againſt the general Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the People, wherein they ſeem to have been much in the wrong. For while I deny not but War is an Evil greatly to be apprehended, ſo it is as true that our fear thereof ought not to ſubject us to ſuffer every thing, and debaſe us into Villanage to avoid it. For why do we keep ſuch a ſtir about preſerving Equality among the Citizens, and the freedom of Speech in Deliberations? Why, in ſhort, does the name of Liberty bear ſuch a Price among us, if there were not ſomething more valuable than Peace it ſelf? For what
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61906:295"/>Man ever applauded the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who out of fear of the Dangers they muſt have been expos'd to, for the ſake of the general Good of <hi>Greece,</hi> during the <hi>Median</hi> War, enter'd into Confederacy with the <hi>Perſians.</hi> I am not therefore of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s mind, who to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that weak Action hath ſaid ſomewhere in his Writings, <hi>That a wiſe Citizen, who would ſtudy the true Welfare of his Country, prefers above all things the Benefits and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Peace.</hi> And he thought perhaps that he had all the World of his ſide, while on the contrary he could-not have broach'd a more pernicious and ſcandalous Opinion. For as there is nothing more eligible and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, than Peace on Conditions Juſt and Honourable: So nothing can be more hurtful or ſhameful, than when 'tis purchas'd by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, and ſtain'd with baſe and infamous Ends.</p>
                     <p>However it were, the Principal Citizens of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> who had no further Proſpect than private and preſent Profit, purſu'd Peace more paſſionately than they ought. 'Tis true, that at the price of many Evils which they were content to ſuffer, they ſhunn'd ſome preſent Fears and Dangers: But the Diſeaſe increaſing by degrees, they by thoſe Meaſures brought their Country at long run into grievous Calamities. The beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I can conceive may be render'd in their defence, is, That they were Borderers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61906:296"/>on the two moſt conſiderable States, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> but of <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> of whom, the one was always their moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemy, from their firſt poſſeſſing of that Country; the other a peaceable Neighbour, wiſhing them well and deſiring their preſervation. Nevertheleſs they had never openly declar'd themſelves either Friends to the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> or Enemies to the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> Wherefore when at any time thoſe two People chanc'd to differ, or were otherwiſe engag'd in War, the <hi>Meſſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> found their account thereby, and enjoy'd their repoſe: But when ever the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were diſingag'd from other Wars, they preſently enter'd on new Deſigns to moleſt and ſubdue the <hi>Meſſenians;</hi> who never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to contend with a Power ſo much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to their own: Nor had ever made any Friend, who would adventure any thing in their behalf; ſo they became oblig'd at length, either to comply with the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> and patiently ſubmit to the Yoke they impos'd; or otherwiſe to abandon their Country with their Wives and Children. In ſhort, they had already frequently felt theſe hardſhips, and but a very little before taſted thereof. And it were much to be wiſh'd, that the Affairs of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> could be ſettl'd on ſuch a Baſis, and the care of its Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might ſo affect Mens Minds, that there
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61906:296"/>ſhould be no occaſion of applying ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as I ſhall mention by and by. But in caſe any general Change or Revolution ſhould threaten, my Judgment is, that there is no Courſe or Counſel ſo wholſome for the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> and <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> to preſerve them in a ſafe and laſting Poſſeſſion of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as the contracting a firm and ſincere Union one with another in every thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Advice of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and to preſerve their Friendſhip inviolate.</p>
                     <p>In concluſion, this Counſel may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd from ancient Story. For the <hi>Meſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> not to mention other matters, erected a Column in the Reign of <hi>Ariſtomenes</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Lycaeus,</hi> where according to the report of <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> this Inſcription was engraven:</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Fate will not always favour Tyrants rule;</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Meſſenian Jove</hi> their ruin hath decreed.</l>
                        <l>Whatever Ills are done, no Ills are hid</l>
                        <l>From the Divinity's all-ſeeing Eye.</l>
                        <l>Grant then, O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom all adore,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Arcadia</hi> may be ſtill in thy protection.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>It is not improbable but that when they were driven from their Country, they then erected this Column, with the Inſcription, to implore as it were the Favour of the Gods, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to them their ſecond abode. Nor was it indeed without good reaſon; for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61906:297"/>did not only receive them into their City, upon their being compell'd to abandon their Country during the War of <hi>Ariſtomenes,</hi> but admitted them to a Fellowſhip of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges with their Citizens, and conſented to their mixing with them in Marriage. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore upon diſcovery of the evil Purpoſes of King <hi>Aristocrates,</hi> they put him to death and exterminated his whole Race with him. But to look no further into ancient Story, what hath come to paſs ſince <hi>Megalopolis</hi> and <hi>Meſſena</hi> were reſtor'd, makes proof enough of the truth of what we have been obſerving. For after the Battel the <hi>Greeks</hi> fought near <hi>Mantinaea,</hi> where the Victory became unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, through the loſs of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> in hopes of getting <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina</hi> into their Hands, would have excluded them from the Treaty of Confederacy, while the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Party obſtinately oppos'd it; and ſo far prevail'd in favour of the <hi>Meſſeninas,</hi> that they came at length to exclude the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> themſelves from the Treaty.</p>
                     <p>Now if Poſterity can but reflect with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on theſe things, we ſhall not be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd for having thus inlarg'd on the Points we have been treating. And it will be perceiv'd that what hath been deliver'd, is in ſervice of the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> and <hi>Arcadians;</hi> to the end that bearing in mind the Injuries they have receiv'd from the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> they may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61906:297"/>be incited to a cloſer Union in their Alliances: And that whenſoever they would deliberate rightly about the ſecurity of eithers Eſtate, it may grow into an eſtabliſh'd Principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to admit no breach in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, either through fear of War, or love of Peace.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> they, according to their manner, diſmiſs'd in the end the Ambaſſadors of the Allies, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; ſo much had their Folly and Pride pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on their Judgment; which verifies a good old Saying, That great Preſumption is but another name for Vanity and Weakneſs of Mind. Afterward, on creation of their new <hi>Ephori,</hi> thoſe who had been the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the State, and were guilty of all that Bloodſhed we have noted, diſpatch'd advice to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> counſelling them to ſend Ambaſſadors to <hi>Sparta;</hi> which they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd, and <hi>Machatas</hi> ſoon arriv'd on the part of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> whereupon he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> demanding that <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> might be heard in the Publick Aſſembly; then he propos'd the coming to a creation of their Kings according to ancient cuſtom, and that it was not to be ſuffer'd, and againſt the tenure of their Laws, that the Dominion of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> ſhould be diſcontinu'd. None of the Propoſitions pleas'd the <hi>Ephori;</hi> but wanting ſtrength to ſtem the Current of the oppoſite Faction; and fearing violence from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61906:298"/>the hot-headed young Men, they reply'd, That as to what concern'd the Kings, they would take it into deliberation. In the mean time, they were forc'd to aſſemble the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give audience to <hi>Machatas:</hi> And being met, he there appear'd, and ſpake many things to diſpoſe them to an Alliance with the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> impudently and unjuſtly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and extolling and fooliſhly exaggerating the Praiſes of the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> When he had left the Aſſembly, great and warm Debates aroſe touching the Propoſitions he had made, one Party holding with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and another violently oppoſing them. But at length, after certain of the graveſt Senators had reminded the People, on the one hand, of the fruit they had reap'd by the good Offices of <hi>Antigonus</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> and, on the other, the Outrages of <hi>Charixenus</hi> and <hi>Timaeus,</hi> when the <hi>Aetolians</hi> broke in upon the Lands of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and putting all to Fire and Sword, carry'd a multitude of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People away captive; and did their beſt to ſurprize and ruine <hi>Sparta</hi> it ſelf, aided therein by thoſe who were under the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Baniſhment whom they took with them: The People thereupon were wrought to change their mind, and reſolve to continue firm to their Alliance with King <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> So <hi>Machatas</hi> return'd home, without any fruit of his Negotiation.</p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61906:298"/>
                     <p>And now the Authors of the late Sedition, diſſatisfy'd with theſe Proceedings, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to acquieſce to the preſent Methods of Adminiſtration, corrupted certain Perſons to engage with them in a moſt deteſtable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. It is the Cuſtom of their young Men to aſſtmble once a Year in Arms, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate a Sacrifice in the Temple of <hi>Minerva Chalciaeca;</hi> in the performance of which Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, the <hi>Ephori</hi> are oblig'd principally to be preſent, and direct all things relating to the ſaid Sacrifice. At this Solemnity then, a Party of thoſe, who were in Arms to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Feaſt with greater Pomp, fell on the <hi>Ephori</hi> while they were miniſtring, killing them in the very Temple, tho' it were a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary even to thoſe who were under Sentence of Death: And forgetting what was due to that ſacred Place, murder'd thoſe of their Party at the Table, and before the Altar of the Goddeſs. Afterwards, to compleat what they had projected, they caus'd <hi>Gyridas,</hi> and many other Senators, to be put to death, and baniſhing the reſt of the <hi>anti-Aetolian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, came to an Election of new <hi>Ephori</hi> of their own Stamp, and proceeded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Confederacy with the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> So great was their Hatred to the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians.</hi> But the whole World was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that all their other Counſels were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the ſame Steps of Imprudence and Temerity; being indeed diſpos'd to that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61906:299"/>of Government through their Inclination to <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> whoſe eſcape from the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and return to <hi>Sparta,</hi> they wiſh'd and daily expected. Such Impreſſions of Love doth the Gentleneſs of Princes leave in Men's Minds, that whether preſent or abſent, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> kindles ſuch Sparks of Gratitude and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, as are not preſently extinguiſh'd: And tho' it were now three Years ſince <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s flight, and the City had been govern'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ancient Inſtitutions, there had not been ſo much as one motion made in <hi>Sparta</hi> for the Election of their Kings: But the news of his Death was no ſooner publiſh'd when both the People and <hi>Ephori</hi> proceeded to deliberate thereupon. The <hi>Ephori,</hi> who were of the Faction of the Seditious, and had made Alliance with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> choſe for one of their Kings <hi>Ageſipolis,</hi> whoſe Father was <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Leonidas,</hi> he being the neareſt in Blood. They appointed for his Governour <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the Son of <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus,</hi> and Brother to the firſt <hi>Ageſipolis.</hi> As to the other King, altho' <hi>Archidamus</hi> left two Children begotten of the Daughter of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon;</hi> and there were others of the ſame Lineage, but more remote, tho' they were of the Family; yet theſe were rejected, and the Royalty conferr'd on <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended not from any one Anceſtor that had worn the Crown. But at the price of a Talent he beſtow'd on each of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> he bought
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61906:299"/>his Adoption to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and his Title to the Crown of <hi>Sparta.</hi> So true it is, that all Villainies are every-where bought at a price. And it will be ſeen, that the Authors of theſe Violations, were not puniſh'd in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or Children's Children, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liv'd to ſhare the Fruit of their Folly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Machatas</hi> receiving notice of theſe Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, return'd ſpeedily to <hi>Sparta,</hi> where he labour'd his utmoſt with the Kings and the <hi>Ephori,</hi> to diſpoſe them to declare War with the <hi>Achaians,</hi> there being no other means left, whereby to vanquiſh the Difficulties they were now under, with thoſe who oppos'd the Alliance with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Party in <hi>Aetolia</hi> it ſelf. But having at length prevail'd with the Kings and the <hi>Ephori,</hi> he return'd back to his Country, after having, by the Weakneſs of thoſe whom he had gain'd to his purpoſe, ſucceſsfully executed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> he march'd out, and made Incurſions on the Frontiers of the <hi>Argians</hi> with the Troops he had rais'd, with whom was join'd the Militia of the City: So that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Argians</hi> thus by ſurprize, the Enemy eaſily effected their purpoſe. Soon after he took <hi>Polichna, Praſia, Leucas,</hi> and <hi>Cyphas.</hi> He got poſſeſſion likewiſe of <hi>Glimpes</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax;</hi> after which good ſucceſs, the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> proclaim'd War with the <hi>Achaians.</hi> Thus all things ſorting to the Wiſh of the

Aemilius</hi> at the Head of an Army into <hi>Illyria,</hi> againſt <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Pharian,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have made mention in our preceding Book. <hi>Antiochus</hi> enter'd on the War, which was wag'd for the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> after <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> had deliver'd up to him <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais. Lycurgus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta</hi> arrogating the ſame Authority as heretofore <hi>Cleomenes</hi> did, laid ſiege to <hi>Athenaeum,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolitans.</hi> The <hi>Achaians</hi> made Levies of Horſe and Foot to ſuſtain the War that ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61906:300"/>much threatned them. <hi>Philip</hi> march'd out of <hi>Macedon</hi> with an Army of Ten thouſand heavy-arm'd Troops, Five thouſand Targe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, and Eight hundred Horſe. Theſe were the hoſtile Preparations that were then every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where making. Beſides that, the <hi>Rhodians</hi> were at the ſame time engaging in a War with the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> the Quarrel being grounded on the Reaſons we ſhall now deliver.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Byzantines</hi> are ſituate the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly of any People, who by their neigh-hood to the Sea, have all things tranſported to them that miniſter to the ſupply of human Life, or Luxury; but they cannot boaſt of the like Felicity by Land with reſpect to the Sea; their City ſtands ſo on the Coaſt, that no Veſſel can go or come without their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And whatever can be ſupply'd by the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, which yields abundance of every needful thing they are Maſters of. In a word, the Countries bordering on that Sea, afford us plenty of Hides, and of good Slaves, Honey, Wax, ſalted Fleſh, and all ſorts of the like Commodities. The <hi>Byzantines</hi> enjoy likewiſe, by the Benefit of Navigation, all things of the growth of our Countries; as, Oil, Wine, and the like. Bread-Corn is alſo a Commodity among them, which ſometimes they buy, and at other times they ſell. It will concern the <hi>Greeks</hi> then, either not to deal at all in theſe kinds of Merchandice, or to reſolve to Trade without Advantage; if the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61906:301"/>
                        <hi>Byzantines</hi> ſhould at any time enter into League with the <hi>Thracians</hi> or <hi>Galatians:</hi> Or in ſhort, totally to abandon all Commerce with thoſe Countries; for we ſhould be no longer at liberty to Navigate in the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, by reaſon of the ſtraitneſs of the Inlets, and the multitude of <hi>Barbarians</hi> that poſſeſs the Country round about. There is no doubt then, but 'tis the Felicity of the ſituation of Places to which <hi>Byzantium</hi> owes the many Advantages it enjoys; for be it either for the Conſumption of ſuch things whereof they abound, or the Supply of what they want, they Negotiate both with eaſe, by the benefit of their Navigation; nor are thoſe who hold Commerce with them, without their ſhare of Commodity: Wherefore as they are beneficial to every one, ſo the <hi>Greeks</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have a juſt Conſideration for them: And they do not only think they have a right to their Thanks, to but their Succours and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whenſoever they are invaded or preſs'd by their barbarous Neighbours. But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Nature and Situation of this Place is known but to a few, it lying out of the way of the general Commerce of the World; we have therefore thought it worth our Pains to ſhew how it comes to paſs that <hi>Byzantium</hi> enjoys ſo many Advantages, ſuperiour to moſt other Cities. For it is our purpoſe to be ever very particular in this ſort of Subjects, and to endeavour to give ſuch a proſpect of thoſe things as ſhall be found worth remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61906:301"/>as to paint them as it were to the view; at leaſt to engrave ſuch a Picture of them in the Mind, that the Images ſhall be but juſt ſhort of Truth it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>That which we call the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea then, contains in Circuit about nine hundred Leagues; it hath two Outlets or Streights, the one into the <hi>Propontis,</hi> the other gives it Communication with the <hi>Palus-Maeotis;</hi> whoſe Circuit is upwards of three hundred Leagues. And foraſmuch as many eminent Rivers of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and more of the principal Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Europe,</hi> diſcharge themſelves into this Lake, it comes to paſs that when it ſwells by the Tribute of ſo many Waters, it enlargeth and emptieth it ſelf by the Streight into the <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the <hi>Pontus</hi> is deliver'd by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis.</hi> The Mouth or Streight of <hi>Palus-Maeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> is call'd <hi>Boſphorus Cimmerius;</hi> which is in Length about threeſcore Furlongs, in Breadth about thirty, the Extremities whereof are every-where full of Flats and Shelves. The Outlet of the <hi>Pontus</hi> is call'd the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> being in Length about one hundred and twenty Furlongs, but the Breadth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; for at the entrance of the Narrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and <hi>Byzantium,</hi> it is about fourteen Furlongs over; but further out about <hi>Hieron,</hi> a Place ſo call'd on the Coaſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> it is not above twelve Furlongs broad; it is reporred, that <hi>Jaſon</hi> firſt ſacrific'd here to the twelve gods. In a word, there are two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61906:302"/>to which is attributed the perpetual Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one way, that is obſerv'd to run in theſe two Streights: The one plain and intelligible, to every one. For while their Waters are inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly repleniſh'd, by the Income of ſo many great Rivers, there is no other way but by theſe Streights to diſcharge them; for being bounded and confin'd every-where by the Coaſt, the ſurplus of Water neceſſarily and naturally flows out by theſe paſſages. The other cauſe is this; namely, that the Rivers ſwelling with the great rains, their Streams be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby ſo rapid, that mighty quantities of Sand and Soil are by the Torrent convey'd down; which lodging at the bottom, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Water to ſwell ſo much the higher and conſequently augments the Stream we are ſpeaking of. Theſe are the true Cauſes then of this conſtant Current; and we are not to hearken to the Reports of Sea-faring People in theſe caſes, but to have recourſe to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſolid Reaſon, by which alone the natural Cauſes of Things are underſtood.</p>
                     <p>But ſince it is our chance to fall on this Diſcourſe, it will concern us to endeavour that nothing may be left unſaid, that may ſerve to inform the Underſtanding, touching the nature of the Subject we are treating Wherefore we ſhall labour to lay things down as plainly as poſſibly we may, to the end no Doubt may remain on the meaneſt Capacity. And, in truth, there lies an Obligation on
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61906:302"/>us, who live in the preſent Age, to examine things with our utmoſt care and circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as there is nothing remains in theſe our Days undiſcover'd of Earth or Seas, it would be a reproach to fly to Fiction with the Poets and others, who have paid us with Fables, to give us Notions of what themſelves knew nothing. Nor will it become us to tread in the ſteps of Hiſtorians, who have gone before us, who (as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> obſerves) by their weak reaſoning, leave doubtful things more in the dark. Our buſineſs therefore muſt be to win the Faith of the Reader, by the force and evidence of Reaſon. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive then that the <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Palus Maeotis</hi> have been ever receiving, and do at this Day continue to receive, and fill up with the Sand and Rubbiſh that is brought down by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers we mention'd, and will at laſt be totally fill'd up and levell'd; taking it for granted, that the Countries continue their ſituation, and the Cauſes hold their force. For ſince Time is without limits, and the Space ſubject to the Accidents we have noted, every-where bounded and enclos'd; what wonder is it to conceive, That tho' the matter convey'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be never ſo inconſiderable, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time that little will amount to fill a great ſpace? And, in ſhort, 'tis a Rule in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That ſuch things as are ſubject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and diminiſh, have their period ſome time or other, let the ſteps of Progreſſion be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61906:303"/>never ſo ſlow or inviſible. But foraſmuch as the quantity of Matter brought into theſe Seas, or Lakes, is not a little, but without queſtion great, beyond all computation, there remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> no diſpute but the Effect we prognoſticate will be ſoon ſeen, and is indeed now viſible: For the <hi>Palus-Maeotis</hi> is almoſt already fill'd up, where in ſome places there is not now above fifteen or twenty Foot depth of Water, inſomuch as there is no more adventuring to navigate with Ships of Burthen without a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, who is acquainted with the difficulties. Furthermore, whereas this Sea (as our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers have obſerv'd) was heretofore reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with ſalt Water, as the <hi>Pontus</hi> at this day is, 'tis obſervable that it is now a freſh-Water Lake, the ſurface of the ſalt Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurmounted by the acceſſion of ſo much Matter, as is accumulated and brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the means we mention. The like muſt in time fall out in the <hi>Pontus,</hi> and is in ſome meaſure already come to paſs: But this cannot be yet ſo eaſily remark'd, by reaſon of the very great depth of Water in the Channel. Howbeit, thoſe who carefully examine the Matter, may be ſatisfy'd of the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Hence the <hi>Danube</hi> diſcharging his Waters out of <hi>Europe</hi> by ſeveral Outlets, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten a Liſt or Bank of Earth at leaſt forty Leagues long, ſwelling above the ſurface, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a Day's Sail from the Shore: Which Bank is obſerv'd to encreaſe daily by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61906:303"/>of new Matter conſtantly brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; inſomuch as whenſoever Veſſels hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to light upon any of theſe places, which Sea-faring Men call Shelves or Banks, they are for the moſt part broken, and ſuffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck. Take then my Opinion how it comes to paſs that theſe Mounds or Banks of Earth, grow at that diſtance from the Continent, and not nearer to the Shore: The Soil and Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh then, which by the force of the Torrent is convey'd down, is by the prevalence of the Current tranſported ſtill forward into the Sea, as long as there remains any ſtrength in the Stream that keeps it in motion; but as that declines, (which happens by the depth and ſpreading of the Waters, which at length are loſt in the wide Sea) the Matter which was before by the Torrent preſs'd on, ſinks and ſettles to the bottom. And in proportion to the greater or leſs rapidity of the Rivers, theſe Banks or Bars are at a greater or leſs diſtance from the Shore, tho' the depth be great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and the Continent. This is ſeen plainly in the gentleſt and ſmalleſt Streams, whoſe Bars are nearer the Shoar, which yet in great Floods (their Current being quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd) tranſport and remove this Bar at a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance than ordinary into the Sea, in proportion to the ſwiftneſs of the Flood, and the quantity of the Soil it brings down. Hence it will not appear ſtrange, that ſuch a maſs of Matter as we have noted, ſhould grow to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61906:304"/>ſo great a dimenſion, as that which is found at the mouth of the <hi>Danube;</hi> nor that ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Sand only, but that Rocks and Trees ſhould be unrooted and rent from their Seats. It will not then be hard, I ſay, to credit what we have deliver'd, but obſtinacy rather to disbelieve it; ſince we behold the ſmalleſt Brooks to make an eaſie paſſage through all Impediments, which increaſing their Rage they come to pierce, and remove by their violence the hardeſt Rocks, carrying Sand, Stones, and all before them; filling up, and ſo changing the face of things, that the View and Landſcape becomes in a ſhort ſpace quite another proſpect.</p>
                     <p>Let it not be thought ſtrange then, I ſay, that Rivers ſo great and rapid, ſhould produce ſuch effects as we have Calculated, by their deſcent into the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, which we have maintain'd, muſt at length be fill'd up, and levell'd. For he who weighs the matter right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will not only perceive it probable, but neceſſary. For if we reaſon but from hence, that as the Waters of the <hi>Palus-Maeotis</hi> are freſher than thoſe of the <hi>Euxine,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Euxine</hi> in a degree different to thoſe in our Seas; it is a plain conſequence, that the <hi>Euxine</hi> muſt at long run become a Lake of freſh Water, and at length a Moor or Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Continent. But this effect muſt be the product of ſo much a longer ſpace, than it hath been brought to paſs in the <hi>Palus-Moeotis,</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:61906:304"/>by how much the <hi>Euxine</hi> is of greater depth and content than the other: Howbeit, we may juſtly conclude, it will be by ſome degrees proportionably ſooner, by how much more the Rivers there are greater and more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. We have been thus extenſive, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to inform ſuch as think it impoſſible, that the <hi>Euxine</hi> (which hath already viſibly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſome advance towards it) ſhould ever become fill'd up; and that ſo ample a Sea ſhould, in proceſs of time, grow into Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. We had likewiſe a further end by thus enlarging on this Subject; namely, to reprove the fond and fabulous Relations of Sea-faring People, and that the Readers may not do like Children, who being yet ignorant of all things, liſten with aſtoniſhment to every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Tale that is told them: But having their Minds cultivated by the notions of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they may become qualify'd to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the truth or ſalſhood of what they hear.</p>
                     <p>But let us further examine the ſituation of <hi>Byzantium.</hi> The Streight then that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Euxine</hi> and the <hi>Propontis</hi> is in length about fifteen Miles (as was noted): On that part towards the <hi>Euxine,</hi> ſtands the City of <hi>Hieron,</hi> on the extremity thereof; the other part towards the <hi>Propontis,</hi> terminates in the ſpace or opening that lies between <hi>Byzantium</hi> and the oppoſite Shore: Between theſe on the ſide of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in the very narrow of all,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61906:305"/>ſtands the Temple of <hi>Mercury,</hi> built on a Rock, that like a Promontory jets a good way into the Sea, where the Streight is not above five Furlongs broad. Here it was that Report makes <hi>Darius</hi> to have built his Bridge, in his Expedition againſt the <hi>Scythians.</hi> Now foraſmuch as the Coaſt on both ſides, from hence downward towards the <hi>Propontis</hi> trends away ſtreight, and preſerves a parallel diſtance as it goes, the Current by that means moves equally. But as ſoon as theſe vaſt Waters that deſcend from the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea come to be pent up and ſtreighten'd, by the narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage made by the Promontory where the Temple ſtands, which we but now mention'd, on <hi>Europe</hi> ſide, here driven as it were by ſome mighty force, they recoil over to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Shore, and from thence return to the Coaſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> beating on thoſe Head-lands or Promontories call'd <hi>Heſtiae;</hi> and from thence with unſpeakable violence take their courſe over to <hi>Aſia</hi> again, towards that part of the Country call'd the <hi>Ox,</hi> where there ſtands a place bearing that Name, and where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tells us <hi>Io,</hi> having ſwam over the Streight, firſt ſet her Foot. From hence, as one may ſay, being puſh'd off, it takes its courſe at length over to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> where the Waters now dilated and ſpreading themſelves about the Town, the Current loſeth it ſelf, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries but a weak ſtream into the Gulf, but ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in a manner at the Cape call'd the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61906:305"/>
                        <hi>Horn.</hi> In a word, tho' the greateſt part of theſe Waters make their traverſe over again towards the <hi>Aſian</hi> Shore; yet foraſmuch as the ſtrength of the Current is now loſt, the motion ceaſeth ere it arrives ſo far as <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſituate on that Coaſt. For after ſo many reverberations, the Streight now opening wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the force of the Stream being ſpent, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach directly over; but with a kind of Biaſs declines and ſteals away. And leaving <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> dies in the Channel, and ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues a direct courſe by the Streight.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes to paſs that <hi>Byzantium</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys ſo many Benefits, and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ſo few; while to the view one would be apt to judge their ſituation equally Advantageous. But as we have noted, the Navigation to the one is very tedious and difficult; while to the other the Stream compels, and gives a quick and eaſie paſſage. Hence thoſe, who are bound from <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> cannot ſtand directly over, by reaſon of the ſtrength of the Current; but are forc'd firſt to gain the Point call'd the <hi>Ox,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Chryſopolis;</hi> whereof the <hi>Athenians</hi> were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore poſſeſs'd, and were the firſt, who by the Counſel of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> exacted a Toll from all that Traded into the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea. From hence advancing a little, they fall at length into the Current, which then forceth them away directly to <hi>Byzantium.</hi> The like happens whether you are bound upward or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61906:306"/>downward to this place. For if Ships are bound from the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> towards the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine,</hi> while the Wind blows at South, or from the <hi>Euxine</hi> towards the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Levants;</hi> the Paſſage is direct and eaſie along the Coaſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> from <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium</hi> to the Streight of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> where ſtand the Towns of <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Abydus.</hi> But thoſe who ſail from <hi>Chalcedon</hi> coaſting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, find quite the contrary; for they are forc'd to ply and turn to Windward, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Land of the <hi>Cyzicenians,</hi> which runs far out into the Sea. In ſhort, as 'tis difficult for thoſe who are bound from the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> to <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to Coaſt it along on the <hi>Europe</hi> ſide; ſo when they arrive near <hi>Byzantium</hi> 'tis as hard to fetch over to <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> through the exceeding violence of the Current, and the other Impediments we have mention'd, which croſs their Paſſage. It is impoſſible then to arrive directly from thence at the Coaſt of <hi>Thrace,</hi> by reaſon of the ſtrength of the oppoſing Current and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds; which, let us ſtand which way ſoever we can, blowing almoſt conſtantly Trade, is ever out of the way for that Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. For as the Southerly Winds blow fair to waft us into the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, and the oppoſite Point is fair to bring us back; ſo but with one or the other of theſe two Winds 'tis impoſſible to gain our Paſſage. Thus have we open'd the Cauſes from whence theſe great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61906:306"/>Benefits arrive to the <hi>Byzantines</hi> by Sea: And what we ſhall now further obſerve, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Reaſon of their Misfortunes by Land.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Byzantium</hi> ſtands in the Country of <hi>Thrace,</hi> which borders on and begirts their Territory quite round from Sea to Sea, whence it comes to paſs that the <hi>Byzantines</hi> are in perpetual Hoſtility with that People. And by how much theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> are a very numerous Nation, and govern'd by many Princes; by ſo much is the Task more difficult to reduce them; nor have the <hi>Byzantines</hi> any proſpect of being able, with all the Proviſion they can make, ever to deliver themſelves from the Moleſtations of that War. For when at any time they chance to obtain any ſignal Victory over any one of theſe Princes, they are ſure to have three or four combine with much greater Power to revenge and ingage in the Quarrel. And in caſe they ſhould be diſpos'd for Peace ſake to yield to pay the leaſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to any one of theſe their Neighbours, they were to expect by gaining one Friend to purchaſe five Enemies. Whence it falls out, that in this Warfare there can be no end; and there is nothing more irkſome than the Neighbourhood of ſo brutal a Race of Men, or more terrible than Hoſtility with a barbarous Enemy. Furthermore, over and above all theſe Evils to which they ſtand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Landward, they are condemn'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61906:307"/>to one kind of ſuffering, not unlike that to which the Poets have ſentenc'd <hi>Tantalus.</hi> For poſſeſſing a rich and fruitful Territory, which they take care to Cultivate, their Harveſt is no ſooner ripe, when theſe Thieves viſit them, and rob them for the moſt part of the Fruit of their Labour; which misfortune they lament in vain. Thus then the <hi>Byzantines</hi> become familiar with the Calamities they ſuffer, and by the force of Cuſtom endure the Hardſhips of inceſſant Hoſtilities, perſiſting to preſerve their ancient Alliances with the <hi>Greeks</hi> invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. But after the <hi>Gauls</hi> (to fill the Meaſure of their Adverſity) came to be their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, under the leading of <hi>Comontorius,</hi> their Condition became then moſt deplorable.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Gauls</hi> were a part of thoſe who ſwarm'd out of their Country with <hi>Brennus;</hi> who, after the execution done on them at <hi>Delphos,</hi> did not preſently paſs into <hi>Aſia</hi> on their arrival at the <hi>Helleſpont;</hi> but invited by the Fertility of the Country about <hi>Byzantium,</hi> reſolv'd there to ſix their Abode. Afterwards ſubduing the <hi>Thracians,</hi> they eſtabliſh'd a Regal Seat in <hi>Tula,</hi> and grew quickly to be Formidable to the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> whom they drove to great Streights; being oblig'd on <hi>Comontorius</hi> his invading and ſpoiling their Frontiers, to buy off that Burden by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Preſent; ſometimes of three Thouſand <hi>Aurei;</hi> ſometimes of five Thouſand; and ſome Years it amounted to no leſs than ten
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61906:307"/>Thouſand, whereby to redeem their Country from the Rapine of theſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Till at length they became driven to be plain Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to the yearly ſumm of fourſcore Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which laſted to the Reign of <hi>Clyarus;</hi> In whom the <hi>Gallic</hi> Dominion expired; the whole Nation being utterly exterminated by the <hi>Thracians.</hi> It was at this time that the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> ſinking under the weight of their Adverſity, ſent their Ambaſſadors to ſollicit Succours from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſeek Relief from the many Hardſhips they endur'd. And, in a word, preſs'd by their Wants they came at length to a Reſolution of exacting a Toll, from all who navigated into the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea; for but few of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it ſeems, laid their Sufferings to Heart. But they no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to levy this Duty, when the Innovation was reſented on all Hands, and the <hi>Rhodians</hi> above the reſt were cenſur'd, who being at that time Maſters of the Sea, ſubmitted to ſo undue an Impoſition. And this, in a word, produc'd the War which we are about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rhodians</hi> then provok'd, as well by their own ſeeling of this new Tax, as through the Inſtigation of others, diſpatch'd their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors jointly with thoſe of their Allies to the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> to perſuade them to aboliſh it.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61906:308"/>we ſhall now relate. After the Death of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi> Father of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and that <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> his Eldeſt Son had taken poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, <hi>Achaeus</hi> accompany'd him in his March and Paſſage over Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> about two Years before thoſe Matters were tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereof we ſhall by and by make relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Seleucus</hi> had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, when he receiv'd Intelligence that <hi>Attalus</hi> had already ſeiz'd and brought under his Dominion all that part of <hi>Aſia</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this ſide Mount <hi>Taurus;</hi> whereupon he forthwith fell prudently to deliberate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Affairs of his Government. But he had no ſooner paſs'd Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> at the Head of a powerful Army, when by the treaſonable Practices of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> and Villainy of one <hi>Apaturius</hi> a <hi>Gaul,</hi> he was Murder'd. But <hi>Achoeus</hi> ſoon compaſs'd a juſt Revenge on the Traytors for the Death of the King his Kinſman; and taking upon him the Conduct of the Army and the Government, manag'd all things with great Prudence, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in all his Deportments a ſingular ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and vivacity of Mind. And albeit the Soveraign Authority became now left to his Election, and the People freely courted him with Tenders of the Diadem, he nevertheleſs rejected the Offer; and determining to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Succeſſion to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Brother of the dead King, led the Army from place to place, and manag'd the War ſo proſperouſly,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61906:309"/>that he ſoon recover'd all that had been loſt on this ſide the Mountains. But vanquiſh'd at length by the Temptations of his Felicity, and after having beaten and confin'd <hi>Attalus</hi> to his own City of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and reduc'd all thoſe places that had been forceably poſſeſs'd, he renounc'd all thoſe noble and generous Purpoſes he had taken; and invading the Dominion, conſented to be call'd King, and became the moſt active and formidable Prince of all on this ſide Mount <hi>Taurus;</hi> inſomuch, as barely on the proſpect of his Friendſhip and Aſſiſtance, the <hi>Byzantines</hi> took aſſurance to wage War againſt the joint Forces of King <hi>Pruſias</hi> and the <hi>Rhodians. Pruſias</hi> had an old grudge againſt the <hi>Byzantines;</hi> who either out of inadvertency, or in contempt, had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to dedicate certain Statues, which they had once decreed to erect to him. He had a further motive of Indignation againſt them, for that they had interpos'd their utmoſt good Offices to give a period to the War, that had fallen out betwixt <hi>Attlus</hi> and <hi>Achaeus,</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly that their Reconcilement would not turn to his account on many Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Furthermore, he was diſpleas'd with the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> in that they had ſent their Ambaſſadors to <hi>Attalus,</hi> on the occaſion of his celebrating the Feaſt of <hi>Minerva;</hi> but ſent none to him when he ſolemniz'd the <hi>Soterian</hi> Feſtival. Thus having hoarded in his Mind ſo many various motives of Diſpleaſure, it was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61906:309"/>no wonder he embrac'd with joy the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Rhodians</hi> gave him to diſcharge his Spleen; ſo they reſolv'd by their Ambaſſadors, that the <hi>Rhodians</hi> ſhould attack them by Sea; and he would proſecute them no leſs vigorouſly by Land.</p>
                     <p>Theſe then were the Cauſes and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War which the <hi>Rhodians</hi> declar'd againſt the <hi>Byzantines:</hi> And, in a word, the <hi>Byzantines</hi> engag'd therein with Courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, while their Hopes of the Friendſhip of <hi>Achaeus</hi> laſted: And in proſpect of <hi>Tibites</hi> coming to their aſſiſtance from <hi>Macedon,</hi> they took aſſurance to conclude, that <hi>Pruſias</hi> (whom they moſt apprehended) would then ſhare with them the danger of the War.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pruſias</hi> purſuing the Dictates of his Anger, had already fallen on the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> taking <hi>Hieron,</hi> a Town they had bought ſome Years before, at the price of a great Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in conſideration of the commodious ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Place, both with reſpect to the ſecurity of their Commerce and Navigation into the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, and the greater ſafety of their Slaves, and other Profits ariſing by their Trade on that Coaſt. He likewiſe ſeiz'd on all they poſſeſs'd in <hi>Myſia,</hi> a Territory in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereof they had been long Maſters; while the <hi>Rhodians</hi> furniſh'd out ſix Men of War on their part, to which the Allies adding four more, with this Squadron of ten Sail, they ſtood towards the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> the Command
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61906:310"/>being given to <hi>Xenophon.</hi> Of theſe, nine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd about <hi>Seſtos,</hi> to obſtruct all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, while the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, with one Veſſel only, ſhap'd his courſe towards <hi>Byzantium,</hi> as well to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Motions there, as to ſee whether theſe Preparations for the War had not wrought a change in their Reſolution. But finding them firm and determin'd to abide the War, he return'd to the reſt; and without any Action ſail'd with the whole Squadron back to <hi>Rhodes.</hi> At the ſame time the <hi>Byzantines</hi> diſpatch'd Ambaſſadors anew to <hi>Achaeus,</hi> to ſolicite ſpeedy Succours from him; they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent to <hi>Tibites,</hi> to perſuade him to come in Perſon from <hi>Macedon:</hi> For it was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion that he had a more rightful Claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> than <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> who was his Nephew. In a word, the <hi>Rhodians</hi> obſerving this firmneſs and diligence in the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> were as careful on their part to proſecute their purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>They obſerv'd, That this Obſtinacy which appear'd in the <hi>Byzantines</hi> to ſuſtain the War, was grounded principally on their proſpect of Aids from <hi>Achaeus;</hi> and knowing that <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> Father of that Prince, was at that time under reſtraint in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that he labour'd by all means poſſible to obtain his Enlargement, they therefore reſolv'd to ſend Ambaſſadors to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to prevail with him to put <hi>Andromachus</hi> into their hands. This
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61906:310"/>Matter had been under Treaty heretofore, but not ſo ſolemnly; but at this time it was ſolicited earneſtly, to the end they might be thereby enabled to tranſact their Affairs with <hi>Achaeus</hi> with better effect. In ſhort, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> giving Audience to the Ambaſſadors, did not readily yield to their Demands; for <hi>Andromachus</hi> being both Father to <hi>Achaeus,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Laodice,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> he propos'd to make a better Bargain of him for himſelf: For the Matters that had been in diſpute between him and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> were not yet compos'd. And <hi>Achaeus</hi> having now lately taken the Title of King, was become very powerful, extending his Dominions far and wide. Nevertheleſs, he was at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with to gratifie the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> who at that time could do any thing with him: So he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up <hi>Andromachus</hi> to be by them reſtor'd to his Son. By which grateful Office of theirs, with other Honours publickly decreed to <hi>Achaeus,</hi> they won him from the <hi>Byzantine</hi> Party, in whom lay their greateſt hope of Succours. Another Misfortune beſel them of almoſt equal prejudice to their Affairs: For <hi>Tihites,</hi> whom they had perſwaded to leave <hi>Macedon</hi> to come to their aſſiſtance, dy'd in his Journey; whoſe Death ſo perplex'd their Counſels, that they began to ſink in their Reſolution; while <hi>Pruſias,</hi> animated by their Afflictions, rais'd his Hopes, and preſs'd the War with greater vigour, levying Forces in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61906:311"/>
                        <hi>Thrace,</hi> whereby he ſo ſtreightned the <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> that on the ſide of <hi>Europe</hi> they durſt not look abroad: So that, in a word, being thus fruſtrate of their ſaireſt Hopes, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtreighten'd and in danger from all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they fell at length to deliberate how they might fairly deliver themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cavarus,</hi> King of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> happen'd to be at that time in <hi>Byzantium,</hi> who greatly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting to be a means of compoſing theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities, moſt readily and with great Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offer'd his Mediation between <hi>Pruſius</hi> and the <hi>Byzantines;</hi> whereupon they agreed to commit their Differences to his Arbitrement. When the <hi>Rhodians</hi> came to underſtand this Negotiation of <hi>Cavarus,</hi> and that <hi>Pruſias</hi> had yielded to a Treaty (tho' they would much rather have proſecuted their firſt purpoſe) they diſpatch'd however <hi>Aridices</hi> their Ambaſſador to <hi>Byzantium;</hi> but at the ſame time order'd <hi>Polemocles</hi> with three <hi>Triremes</hi> to make the beſt of his way thither, to offer to them firſt, as 'twas ſaid, their choice of Peace or War.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Arrival of the Ambaſſadors, a Peace in ſhort was concluded, <hi>Hieromnemon Cothon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Calligiton,</hi> being preſent: The Terms of the Treaty with the <hi>Rhodians</hi> were, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Byzantines</hi> ſhould exact no Toll from any Ships that Traded into the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea. On which conſideration, the <hi>Rhodians</hi> and their Allies oblig'd themſelves to preſerve Peace with the <hi>Byzantines.</hi> As to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61906:311"/>King <hi>Pruſias,</hi> the Articles of the Treaty with him were, That there ſhould be perpetual Peace between <hi>Pruſias</hi> and the <hi>Byzantines:</hi> That the <hi>Byzantines</hi> ſhould never lead any Army againſt King <hi>Pruſias,</hi> nor <hi>Pruſias</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Byzantines:</hi> That <hi>Pruſias</hi> ſhould make reſtitution of the Lands, Towns, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Priſoners that had been taken during the War Ranſom-free: Furthermore, that he ſhould reſtore ſuch Veſſels as had been taken at the beginning of the War; all the Arms that were ſeiz'd in their Magazines, together with all the Timber, Marble, Brick, Tyle, and all whatſoever Materials had been carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: (For <hi>Pruſias</hi> apprehending the approach of <hi>Tibites,</hi> had cauſed to be diſmantled all ſuch places as might be of uſe to the Enemy) and, in a word, oblig'd himſelf to cauſe reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to be made to the <hi>Myſians,</hi> who were under the Dominion of the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> of all that had been taken from them by any of the <hi>Bithynians.</hi> Thus was the War enter'd upon and determin'd, that ſell out between King <hi>Pruſias</hi> and the <hi>Byzantines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſame time the <hi>Cnoſſians</hi> ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to the <hi>Rhodians</hi> to demand the Ships that <hi>Polemocles</hi> had Commanded, together with four <hi>Brigantines,</hi> which they had lent them towards the War.

                        <hi>Cnoſſians,</hi> had caus'd <hi>Timarchus,</hi> a Citizen of theirs, to be ſlain; having firſt publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd their Right to demand reparation of this Violence of the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> declar'd War againſt them. There happen'd likewiſe, ſome time before this, a ſtrange Adventure to the <hi>Lyttians,</hi> or rather an incurable Calamity. To ſet down therefore, in few words, a State of the Affairs in <hi>Candia</hi> in thoſe Days, take them a little more or leſs, as follows.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cnoſſians</hi> and <hi>Gortinians</hi> being in league, had by combining their Forces, ſubdu'd the whole Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> the City of <hi>Lyttia</hi> only excepted; which ſtanding ſingly out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and refuſing to ſubmit to their Domination, they agreed to make War upon them, reſolving totally to deſtroy them, to the greater terror of thoſe who ſhould medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the like Deſigns. Whereupon the reſt of the <hi>Candiots</hi> in general fell on the <hi>Lyttians.</hi> But it was not long before a ſlight occaſion (as is the cuſtom of that People) ſet them at variance amongſt themſelves; ſo that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were form'd, and Seditions grew between them. The <hi>Polyrrhenaeans,</hi> the <hi>Creetaeans,</hi> the <hi>Lampaeans, Oryans,</hi> and <hi>Arcadians</hi> left the <hi>Cnoſſians;</hi> and by common Conſent took part with the <hi>Lyttians.</hi> In <hi>Gortinea,</hi> the grave and experienc'd Inhabitants favour'd the <hi>Cnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians;</hi> but the younger ſort taking part with the <hi>Lyttians,</hi> begat great Diſorders in the City. The <hi>Cnoſſians</hi> terrify'd at theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61906:312"/>among their Allies, procur'd an Aid of a Thouſand Men from the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> whereupon the Party that ſided with them, getting the Cittadel, gave it into the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Cnoſſians</hi> and the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſlain ſome that oppos'd them, and purſu'd ſome, and terrify'd the reſt, they gave them up the Town likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lyttians,</hi> in the mean time, led their Troops into the Enemy's Country, while the <hi>Cnoſſians</hi> getting notice of their Expedition, march'd and ſurpriz'd their Town, which they had left with little or no Guard: The Women and Children they ſent to <hi>Cnoſſus,</hi> but the Town they burnt and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, exerciſing all the Spight and Cruelty practis'd in the moſt raging War, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home in Triumph. When the <hi>Lytti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> came from their Expedition, and beheld the Deſolation of their City, they were ſtruck with that horror, that not one of them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur'd to ſet his Foot within the Walls; but marching in a Body round the Ruines, celebrated as it were by their Cries and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations the Obſequies of their Native Place, and then march'd away to the <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeans,</hi> who receiv'd them with all hoſpitality. So that in the ſpace of only one Day, they were baniſh'd their Country, which they had utterly loſt, and receiv'd as free Citizens into another, with whom they incorporated, and proſecuted the War againſt the <hi>Cnoſſians.</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61906:313"/>Thus <hi>Lyttia,</hi> a Colony of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> the moſt ancient City of <hi>Creet,</hi> the Mother of a People ſurpaſſing all the reſt of that Iſland in Courage and Virtue, was deſtroy'd and diſappear'd (as one may ſay) in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

When <hi>Dorimachus</hi> began to perceive the Danger that threaten'd his Party, he endeavour'd to rally and recall his ſcatter'd Troops, and march'd to Attack the Cittadel; making account that the boldneſs of the Attempt would ſo terrify the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that were drawn together for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Fortreſs, that they would incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently fly before him. But the <hi>Aegirates</hi> otherwiſe minded, animating one another, oppos'd themſelves bravely againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and advancing to the Charge, came man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the Sword's point with the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> For the place being without any conſiderable Works about it, the Conteſt was for the moſt part at hand, and a Combat as it were of Man to Man: And, in ſhort, the Diſpute we may imagine was ſuch, as when on the one part Men fight for the Liberty of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and their Families; and on the other, for their Lives and Safety. But the <hi>Aetolians</hi> at length began to retire, and the <hi>Aegirates</hi> as warmly to purſue them, when they once

In concluſion, thoſe of them who were not kill'd on the Spot, periſh'd among the Rocks and Precipices by which way they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to eſcape. Some that gain'd their Veſſels having baſely quitted their Arms, wondring at the fortune of their Eſcape, immediately Embark'd and made Sail away.

Wherefore there ſeems to be no blame due to the <hi>Pharaeans</hi> and the reſt, for having made Levies for their own defence, while the <hi>Achaian</hi> Praetor fail'd them. But they are not without imputation of having done amiſs, in refuſing to contribute however to the Common Stock of the Confederacy.

But the <hi>Epirots</hi> being inſtant with him to ſet firſt down before <hi>Ambracia,</hi> he by that means gave the Enemy time to fortifie and provide for themſelves.

After he had paſs'd this Gulf with his Army, he took his march through <hi>Acarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and drew towards <hi>Phaerea,</hi> an <hi>Aetolian</hi> Town; and recruiting his Army with two thouſand <hi>Acarnanian</hi> Foot, and about two

But the King, receiving an account of their march, poſſeſs'd himſelf of certain advantageous Poſts in their way; and falling on them, cut of the greateſt part of them, taking the reſt Pris'ners, a very few only eſcaping. Then after he had diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thirty Days Corn to the Army (the Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this Town being very well repleniſh'd) he march'd towards <hi>Strategica;</hi> and coming within little more than a Mile of the Place, he encamp'd by the River <hi>Achelous?</hi> From thence continuing his march, he ravag'd the Country round about, no Enemy appearing to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him.</p>
                     <p>About this time the <hi>Achaians,</hi> beginning to feel the ill effects of the War, hearing the King was at hand, ſent their Ambaſſadors to wait on him, and demand Succours.

                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Horſe were got together, and boldly reſolv'd to attempt the obſtructing his Paſſage over the River, about two Miles from the Town, believing they ſhould be able either to hinder his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or at leaſt to do the Army much damage in the attempt. But the King, who had knowledge of their Purpoſe, commanded the Buckler-Men firſt to enter the River, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the other Bank by Troops or Cohorts well cover'd with their Bucklers, after the Tortoiſe manner. Theſe Orders being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, as they gain'd the other Shoar, the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolians</hi> attack'd the advanc'd Party, and in truth made ſome diſpute; but when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd theſe to halt, and to draw into cloſe order, and that the ſecond and third Cohorts joining them, compos'd as it were a Wall of Defence with their Bucklers; they then gave back, and retreated into the Town, deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perform any further Service.</p>
                     <p>After this occaſion, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> preſum'd no more to come into the Field, but ſhut themſelves up in their Places of Defence.

                     <p>After he had paſs'd this Streight, he mov'd by eaſier marches, the better to enable the Soldiers to carry their Plunder.

This was a Place of no great extent, being hardly a Mile about, but no way inferiour to the others, as well for the Beauty of the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as the Strength of the Wall and Works. He caus'd the Fortifications to be raz'd, and the Edifices to be demoliſh'd, taking order with the Timber and Rafters to make Floats to tranſport himſelf to <hi>Oeniade.</hi> The <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſeem'd at firſt reſolv'd to fortifie and keep poſſeſſion of the Citadel of that Place; but on the approach of King <hi>Philip,</hi> the fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd; ſo they quitted that likewiſe.

For King <hi>Attalus</hi> it ſeems had ſupply'd the <hi>Aetolians</hi> with all things needful to the Defence of this Town: But <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> taking it by force, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> waſted all the Country of <hi>Calydonia;</hi> and afterwards he march'd back to <hi>Oeniade.</hi> The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well conſider'd the commodious ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Place, as well for the paſſage it gave into <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> as other Advantages, reſolv'd to fortifie and begirt it with a Wall. <hi>Oeniade</hi> is ſituate on the Sea, upon the very out-skirts of <hi>Acarnania,</hi> where it borders on the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> at the entrance of the Gulf of <hi>Corinth;</hi> it ſtands fronting towards <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> and lies oppoſite to the Coaſt of <hi>Dyma,</hi> and not diſtant above twelve Miles from the Country that borders on <hi>Araxus;</hi> wherefore he fortify'd the Caſtle, and laid the Deſign of joining the Arſenal and the Port, and deſtin'd for that Service the Materials he had caus'd to be tranſported from <hi>Paeanium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But while theſe Things were under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he receiv'd Letters from <hi>Macedon,</hi> whereby he underſtood that the <hi>Dardanians</hi> believing he had taken his march into <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> had reſolv'd to fall on him at home: That they had levy'd Forces for that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and were making great Proviſion of all kinds for proſecuting the War. Whereupon judging it but juſt to repair to the relief of his own Country, he therefore diſmiſſeth the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaian</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61906:321"/>Ambaſſadors, giving them aſſurance, That as ſoon as he ſhould be able to compoſe his Affairs at home, there was nothing more in his Thoughts than to come and give them his utmoſt Aſſiſtance. Whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, marching with great diligence back by the ſame way he came. At his paſſage of the Gulf of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> in his way out of <hi>Acar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nania</hi> into <hi>Epirus,</hi> he was met by <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Pharus,</hi> who had been compell'd to fly out of <hi>Illyria</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi> (as we have already noted) having only one ſingle Veſſel with him. The King receiv'd him kindly, ordering him to go firſt to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and from thence to take his way through <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and come and meet him in <hi>Macedon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <hi>Philip</hi> had paſs'd through <hi>Epirus,</hi> he continu'd his march without halting; and on his arrival at <hi>Pella,</hi> a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Town, the <hi>Dardanians,</hi> who had got intelligence of his return, by certain <hi>Thracian</hi> Fugitives, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd at his diligence and ſudden appearance, diſmiſs'd their Army, after they were got near the Frontiers of <hi>Macedon.</hi> Whereupon having notice that the <hi>Dardanian</hi> Army was broken, he diſmiſs'd the <hi>Macedonians</hi> that were then with him, to go and gather in their Harveſt, paſſing himſelf into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> to ſpend the remaining part of the Summer at <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> About the ſame time, <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> triumph'd magnificently at <hi>Rome,</hi> for his Victory over the <hi>Illyrians:</hi> And <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61906:321"/>after taking <hi>Saguntum</hi> by ſtorm, march'd his Army into Winter-Quarters. The <hi>Romans</hi> now aſſur'd of the loſs of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to demand the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of <hi>Hannibal;</hi> but did not in the mean time reſpite their Preparations for the War, having created <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius Sempronius</hi> Conſuls. But foraſmuch as we have treated at large of theſe Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our preceding Book, we only give here this hint thereof, a little to refreſh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Memory, and to the end contemporary Affairs may be the better underſtood. And here we are come to the end of the Firſt Year of the Hundred and fortieth <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Aetolians</hi> having in their Aſſembly created <hi>Dorimachus</hi> Praetor, he was no ſooner ſeated in his Authority, when aſſembling their Troops he led them into the upper <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> where he acted all the Violences of War, not ſo much now in proſpect of Profit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as in Malice to the <hi>Epirots.</hi> And on his arrival near the Temple of <hi>Dodona,</hi> he there burnt and demoliſh'd all the Portico's, ſpoiling the Ornaments, and deſtroying in ſhort the Temple it ſelf. Thus the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> careleſs of what is practis'd in time of Peace or War, acted ſuch outrageous Parts in both Peace and War, as ſhew'd them ignorant of the Rights and Cuſtoms of human Nature; perſiſting to execute what they had once reſolv'd without
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61906:322"/>regard to Gods or Men. As to <hi>Dorimachus,</hi> after he had done all the ſpoil he could, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to <hi>Aetolia.</hi> And now albeit the Winter was not yet over, and the Seaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded no hopes of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s returning yet awhile; that Prince notwithſtanding, taking with him three thouſand of that ſort of Troops they call <hi>Chalcaſpides;</hi> from their carrying Brazen Shields; two thouſand Buckler-men, three hundred Candiots, and about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe; with this Body of Men he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> and took his march through <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Eubaea,</hi> and thence by <hi>Cynus</hi> to <hi>Corinth;</hi> marching by the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Boeotia</hi> and <hi>Megara;</hi> and in ſhort perform'd his Journey with ſo great ſecreſie and expedition, that the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> had not the leaſt notice of it. On his arrival at <hi>Corinth</hi> he caus'd the Gates of the City to be immediately clos'd, and placing Guards on all the Avenues, ſent the next day to <hi>Sicyon</hi> for the elder <hi>Aratus,</hi> and diſpatch'd Letters to the <hi>Achaian</hi> Praetor, and the ſeveral Towns of <hi>Achaia,</hi> requiring them to let him know, how ſoon they could be able to aſſemble their Troops, and to aſſign a place of Rendezvous. This done he continu'd his march towards <hi>Dioſcurium</hi> a City of <hi>Phliaſia</hi> and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd.</p>
                     <p>At this time <hi>Euripidas</hi> having with him two Cohorts of <hi>Eleans,</hi> and certain Pirats and mercenary Strangers, amounting in all to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61906:322"/>two and twenty hundred Men: With theſe Troops he departed from <hi>Pſophis,</hi> taking his march by <hi>Phoenice</hi> and <hi>Stymphalia,</hi> (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s return) with deſign to attack and plunder the Territory of <hi>Sicyon.</hi> But ſo it chanc'd, that the ſame Night that <hi>Philip</hi> encamp'd near <hi>Dioſcurium,</hi> he march'd by, leaving the King's Army ſomewhat in his Rear, expecting the next Morning to fall on the <hi>Sicyonians.</hi> But his People lighting on certain of the <hi>Candiots,</hi> who had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out to Forage; by theſe Priſoners <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripidas</hi> got notice of the arrival of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians.</hi> Whereupon he march'd back with his Troops without imparting his Intelligence to any Body, taking the ſame Road by which he came, purpoſing to prevent the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and take poſſeſſion of the Rocks and Ground beyond <hi>Stymphalia</hi> that commands the Paſſage. The King, who knew nothing of his Deſign, departed the next day as he had purpos'd, with intention to march by the Town of <hi>Stymphalia</hi> it ſelf, and ſo to <hi>Caphya;</hi> the place appointed for the Rendezvous of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Troops</p>
                     <p>At that very inſtant then, that the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> came to the foot of the Mountain <hi>Apeaurus,</hi> not a Mile from the Town of <hi>Stymphalia;</hi> the Van of the <hi>Eleans</hi> in like manner approach'd the ſame Ground: Which when <hi>Euripidas</hi> perceiv'd, and by what he was told, and by reaſonable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61906:323"/>became throughly ſatisfy'd that it was ſo; he takes with him a Party of Horſe only, and to get himſelf out of danger, eſcapes to <hi>Pſophis,</hi> paſſing over Rocks and By-ways, the better to conceal his flight. The reſt of his Troops beholding themſelves abandon'd of their Leader, and being aſtoniſh'd at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, ſtood a while to conſider what was beſt to be done: For the principal among them were at firſt of Opinion, That it was only: Party of <hi>Achaians</hi> that had been drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and came to the relief of the Country: Then perceiving they bore brazen Shields, they took them for <hi>Megalopolitans:</hi> For it ſeems that People had made uſe of theſe Arms in the Battel that had been fought with <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> near <hi>Selaſia, Antigonus</hi> having ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it. So that keeping themſelves in good Order, they continu'd their March, and with aſſurance approach'd the Mountain. But they no ſooner became certain that they were <hi>Macedonians,</hi> when quitting their Arms, they betook themſelves to ſlight. About twelve Hundred of them were taken, ſome cut in pieces on the place, and many periſh'd among the Rocks and Precipices; and, in a word, not above one Hundred of the whole Party made their Eſcape: So <hi>Philip</hi> ſending the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and the Booty to <hi>Corinth</hi> continu'd his march.</p>
                     <p>This Victory paſs'd for a kind of Miracle among the <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> the news of <hi>Philip</hi>'s
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61906:323"/>Coming and Conquering being told at one and the ſame time. After he had travers'd <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and ſurmounted the Hardſhips of the Snows, and Difficulties of the Ways, he arriv'd in three Days at <hi>Caphya.</hi> Here the King halted for two Days to refreſh his Army; then taking with him <hi>Aratus</hi> the younger, with the <hi>Achaian</hi> Troops which he had there drawn together, amounting to Ten Thouſand Men, he march'd the Army toward <hi>Pſophis</hi> by the way of <hi>Clitoria,</hi> ſeizing on the Arms and Ladders in all the Towns in his march. <hi>Pſophis</hi> is confeſs'd by all without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the moſt ancient City of <hi>Arcadia:</hi> Its ſituation, with reſpect to <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> is in the heart of that Country; with reſpect to <hi>Arcadia</hi> it ſtands on the Weſt-borders thereof, towards the <hi>Achaian</hi> Frontiers, in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the <hi>Elean</hi> Territory, with whom at that time they were in League. Hither <hi>Philip</hi> arriving in three Days from <hi>Caphya,</hi> Encamp'd on certain Eminences that lie front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town; from whence there is an eaſie proſpect (out of all danger) both of the Town and Neighbouring Villages round about. From hence then taking a view of the great ſtrength of the place, he grew in doubt what to determine; for on the Weſt ſide there runs a rapid Stream, which during almoſt all the Winter is no way fordable: This on that ſide fortifies the Town, and by the depth of its Channel, renders it almoſt inacceſſible, the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61906:324"/>Waters falling from on high, having in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time worn it to great depth. On the Eaſt-ſide runs the <hi>Erymanthus,</hi> a great and violent River, whereof many Tales are told, and are in every ones mouth. On the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where the Torrent empties into the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymanthus,</hi> the Town is environ'd with many Waters, which give it great ſtrength on that Quarter. As to the other part that regards the North, there ſtands an Eminence very ſtrong by Nature, and exceedingly improv'd by Art; and this work ſerv'd them for a Citadel. Furthermore, the Walls and Works about the Town were conſiderable both for height and ſtructure. And over and above all this, the <hi>Eleans</hi> had furniſh'd the place with a good Garriſon; and <hi>Euripidas,</hi> who had eſcap'd in the late Defeat, was in the Town.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> had well weigh'd all theſe Matters, ſometimes he reſolv'd not to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Beſiege them; but ſoon again he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of another Mind, when he reflected on the great Importance of the place: For as it greatly annoy'd at that time both the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Arcadians,</hi> ſo it was a Rampier and Bulwark of the <hi>Eleans;</hi> he foreſaw that were it once in his poſſeſſion, it would become an admirable Fortreſs whereby to cover the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi> againſt the Inſults of the Enemy, and an excellent place of Arms and retreat for the Allies, who made War on the <hi>Eleans.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61906:324"/>he became at length reſolv'd to attempt the Siege; and ordering his Troops to refreſh themſelves, and to be in a readineſs under their Arms by break of Day, he commanded them to march down and paſs the Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Erymanthus;</hi> which they did without any Impediment, none ſuſpecting they would adventure on ſo hardy an Enterprize: Then bravely approaching the Town, they came and lodg'd themſelves at the foot of the Wall. Upon this, <hi>Euripidas</hi> and all within the Town were ſtruck with great Terror and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, having always concluded it moſt improbable, that the Enemy would ever be ſo adventurous, as to make an eſſay of their Strength againſt a place ſo well fortify'd and provided; nor to reſolve on a long Siege, by reaſon of the Winter and bad Weather. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, with theſe Thoughts were mix'd certain Jealouſies among themſelves, and an apprehenſion leſt <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould become Maſter of the Place by intelligence. But theſe Fears were ſoon over; and after they found there was no ground of Suſpicion of that, there being none ſo much as inclin'd to <hi>Philip</hi>'s Party, they then unanimouſly betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the defence of the Works, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Garriſon mounting the Walls, while the <hi>Elean</hi> Mercenaries made a Sally by a Gate in the upper part of the Town, to ſurprize the Enemy on that ſide. In the mean time, the King having appointed three
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61906:325"/>ſeveral Attacks, order'd Ladders to be rais'd by People deſtin'd to that particular Service, againſt each aſſign'd place, with a ſufficient Guard of <hi>Macedonians</hi> to ſuſtain them: Then commanding to ſound to the Charge, they advanc'd to the Aſſault on all Quarters of the Town. The Garriſon for a ſpace made brave reſiſtance, caſting down many of their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But it coming to paſs that their Darts, and other Weapons of Defence in ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, beginning to fail them (for they were drawn to the Walls in haſte, as was noted) and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> bravely maintaining the Attack, notwithſtanding the oppoſition they found, new Men boldly ſucceeding and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the places of thoſe who had been caſt from the Works; that the Townſmen, no longer able to withſtand them, deſerted their Defence, and betook themſelves for ſafety to the Citadel: So the <hi>Macedonians</hi> mounted, and became poſſeſs'd of the Walls; while the <hi>Candiots,</hi> who were come to Blows with the Party that had made the Sally, beat them back, and in the purſuit enter'd pell-mell with them into the Town; whereby it ſo chanc'd, that the place was ſubdu'd and taken in all Quarters at once. The Inhabitants, with their Wives and Children likewiſe took San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the Citadel, as did <hi>Euripidas,</hi> and all that had time to provide for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:61906:325"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> were no ſooner Maſters of the Town when they fell to plunder and rifle both publick and private Places, where they remain'd till they ſhould receive further Orders. In the mean while, thoſe who had retir'd to the Citadel, foreſeeing what muſt inevitably beſal them, having nothing there to ſuſtain them, deliberated on yielding it up; accordingly they ſent a Trumpet to the King, who gave them his Paſs for the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe whom they ſhould appoint to Treat; who were the principal Men of the City, and with them <hi>Euripidas,</hi> who obtain'd Indemnity for all who were retir'd to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, both Towns-Men and Strangers. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the Deputies were order'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back, and there to remain till the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould be drawn off, leſt ſome of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Soldiers, leſs obſervant of the King's Commands, ſhould be tempted to rifle them.</p>
                     <p>The Weather being bad (much Snow fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) the King was conſtrain'd to take up his abode here for ſome days, where aſſembling all the <hi>Achaians</hi> that were with him, he firſt diſcours'd with them touching the ſituation of the Place; that it was well fortify'd, and of great uſe to them in the War they had on their hands. Then repeating the aſſurances of his faſt Friendſhip to the Nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, he beſtow'd the Town upon them, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, he was fully determin'd to give them all the aſſiſtance in his utmoſt Power,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61906:326"/>and would let no occaſion paſs, whereby he might expreſs his Affection to them. After <hi>Aratus,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Achaians</hi> had expreſs'd their grateful Acknowledgments for ſo many Favours and good Offices, the King diſſolv'd the Aſſembly, and march'd the Army away towards <hi>Laſion;</hi> upon which the <hi>Pſophidians</hi> left the Citadel, and came down into the Town to their reſpective Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As to <hi>Euripidas,</hi> he departed thence to <hi>Corinth,</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Aetolia.</hi> The Magiſtrates of the <hi>Achaians</hi> gave the Government of the Citadel to <hi>Proſlaus</hi> the <hi>Sicyonian,</hi> placing therein a good Garriſon, and <hi>Pythias</hi> they made Governor of the Town. Thus were Matters accommodated at <hi>Pſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Elean</hi> Garriſon in <hi>Laſion</hi> receiving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the approach of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and being inform'd of what had paſs'd at <hi>Pſophis,</hi> deſerted the Town; into which the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enter'd; on his arrival, to give further inſtance of his Kindneſs to the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he made them a Preſent likewiſe of this Place. He alſo reſtor'd <hi>Stratus</hi> to the <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuſſians,</hi> which the <hi>Eleans</hi> had abandon'd; and, in ſhort, in five Days marcht to <hi>Olymphia,</hi> where after he had ſacrific'd, and magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated the prime Officers of the Army, and allow'd three Days to repoſe and refreſh his Troops, he march'd them into the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Eleans;</hi> where he no ſooner enter'd,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61906:326"/>when he ſent Detachments abroad to waſte and plunder the Country, himſelf encamping in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Artemiſſium,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having order'd the Booty to be brought, he afterwards return'd back to <hi>Dioſcurium.</hi> And here, tho' they put all to Fire and Sword where-ever they came, and took many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; nevertheleſs, the greater part ſav'd themſelves by flying to the neighbouring Towns and Places of ſtrength. For the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of the <hi>Eleans</hi> is the beſt Peopled Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of all <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and the moſt abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things; for the Inhabitants are for the moſt part ſo in love with a Country Life, that how Wealthy ſoever they are, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawn from thence to inhabit their Towns.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this ſeems to be, that the Government greatly incourageth that ſort of Life, whereby their Lands become better cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated and improv'd; inſomuch as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them all kind of Protection, and want no Privilege or Support it can give them. For my own part, I can eaſily believe they have been ever heretofore addicted to that manner of Living, as well through the fertility of the Soil, as the innocence and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Manners of the ancient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, while by the general conſent of the <hi>Greeks</hi> they enjoy'd their Poſſeſſions without any Moleſtation; or fear of War or Violence;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61906:327"/>in conſideration of the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games that were there celebrated.</p>
                     <p>But after the <hi>Arcadians</hi> had now Challeng'd a right to <hi>Laſion</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> and they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come oblig'd to take Arms to defend their Poſſeſſions, they became chang'd in their Manners, and forgot the ancient Cuſtoms of their Country: without thought of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their old Liberty, and have long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd for the moſt part in that ſtate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>methinks, they manifeſt a very ſtupid neglect of their own proper Benefit, and the Advantage of Poſterity. For ſince Peace is a Bleſſing which Mankind in general ask of the Gods; and for the ſake whereof there is hardly any thing we are not ready to do or ſuffer; and ſince among all thoſe things that bear the name of Goods of Human Life, that alone remains undiſputed; does it not ſeem a mighty Error then, and blindneſs of Mind, that while this Bleſſing may be honeſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and perpetually enjoy'd to deſpiſe ſuch a Treaſure, and not eſteem it a Felicity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to all others? But let it be Objected, That ſuch a ſort of Government would expoſe them to the Inſolence and Injuries of thoſe, who ſhould have a mind to make War on them, and violate their Faith. But this can but very rarely come to paſs, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of ſuch Violences, and the ready Succours of the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Nation would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61906:327"/>ſoon remedy ſuch an Evil. And after all, Riches being the certain Product of long Peace, they would never want Mercenaries for their Money, whereby to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Garriſon their Places of Defence; while now in theſe our Days, out of a vain fear of what is very unlikely ever to happen, their Jealouſies one of another beget nothing but War and Violence; and the mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of each other. We have thus light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch'd this ſubject in our way, to give a hint only to the <hi>Eleans</hi> of their proper Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and the rather inaſmuch as they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to ſee a more favourable conjuncture, whereby to regain their loſt Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. In a word, if the <hi>Eleans</hi> chance at this Day to retain any kind of preference to their ancient manner of Country Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it ſeems to be no other than ſome faint remains of their old Cuſtoms, which are not yet quite extinguiſh'd.</p>
                     <p>Hence then it came to paſs, that when <hi>Philip</hi> fell in upon them, ſo many Priſoners were taken, and yet that ſo many notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding made their eſcape into their Towns. To the Fortreſs of <hi>Thalamé</hi> eſpecially many reſorted, where they ſecur'd much Cattel, and great quantities of their Moveables; that Place being ſtrongly ſituate, and the Avenues difficult, and ſtanding remote from all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and almoſt every way inacceſſible. But when the King became inform'd, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61906:328"/>many of the Enemy had retir'd thither, he thought himſelf oblig'd to attempt (at leaſt his beſt) to diſlodge them: Wherefore having firſt gain'd all the difficult Paſſes, whereby his Army might march with ſecurity, he left his Baggage in the Camp, guarded with a good part of his Army, and taking with him only his Buckler-men, and light-arm'd Troops, march'd through the Defiles which lead to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Thalamé.</hi> Thoſe who were within the place, terrify'd at his approach, having been but little converſant in War, and wanting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing for their defence; and there being great numbers of the baſer ſort of People mix'd with them, ſoon ſubmitted, albeit they had a ſtrength with them of two hundred Mercenary Soldiers that had been brought thither by <hi>Amphidamas</hi> an Officer of the <hi>Eleans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Philip</hi> was Maſter of <hi>Thalamé,</hi> and the Booty they had there lodg'd, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with five Hundred Men, who were made Priſoners, and much Cattel of all ſorts, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to his Camp. And now his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being over-charg'd with Booty, whereby they became greatly hinder'd in their march, and all Military Expeditions, he found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to retire further, and re-encamp at <hi>Olympia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the Tutors and Governors left by <hi>Antigonus</hi> to King <hi>Philip,</hi> who came a Child to the Crown, <hi>Apelles</hi> was one, who had
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61906:328"/>preſerv'd a powerful influence over the young Prince. This Perſon then having conceiv'd a project of reducing the <hi>Achaians</hi> to the ſtate wherein the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> then were, began his Deſign by means malicious enough: For tho' it ſeem'd to him, that the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> were a free People, and liv'd in the enjoyment of all their Rights and Liberties, and their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quite otherwiſe than that of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> nevertheleſs, he was therein deceiv'd, for there was little or no difference between them, the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> living liable to the ſame uſage with the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> being oblig'd to do and ſubmit to every thing the great Men of the Kingdom thought fit. Now foraſmuch as <hi>Apelles</hi> bent all his Thoughts towards the compaſſing his Deſign, his firſt eſſay was on the Patience of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Soldiers, who ſerv'd at that time in the Army; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caus'd the <hi>Macedonians</hi> frequently to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge them, and poſſeſs their Quarters, when they found them at any time better provided than themſelves; and often to deprive them of their Plunder. In a word, he caus'd them to be ſeverely treated by the common Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners on every ſlight occaſion: And if at any time they complain'd, or the Soldiers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to reſcue their Friends from ſuch hard Treatment, he caus'd them to be taken into Cuſtody; conceiving, that by this ſort of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, he ſhould be able, by degrees, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerv'd to bring the <hi>Achaians</hi> to bear by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61906:329"/>any burthen the King ſhould think fit to lay upon them.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Apelles</hi> was not without hopes of compaſſing his purpoſe, from his having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that heretofore in the time of <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the <hi>Achaians</hi> cheerfully underwent many Hardſhips, to purchaſe their exemption from the Authority of <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> But ſo it chanc'd, that certain <hi>Achaian</hi> Soldiers, provok'd by this Uſage, aſſembled themſelves, and went and imparted the Project and Practice of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> to <hi>Aratus:</hi> Who thereupon apply'd himſelf to the King, to obtain a Remedy for this Evil ere it got a head. <hi>Philip</hi> now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of what had been done, call'd theſe Soldiers to him, and gave them aſſurance that care ſhould be taken for the future, that no ſuch Injury ſhould be offer'd them, bidding them rely on his Word; and accordingly he order'd <hi>Apelles</hi> to determine nothing at any time about the <hi>Achaian</hi> Soldiers, without firſt communicating with their Praetor, or Chief Officer. Thus <hi>Philip</hi> acquir'd a mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, not only among his own Subjects, but throughout all <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> as well by his manner of Treatment of the Allies in the Camp, as by his perſonal Courage, Vigilance, and Abilities in War. And in truth it would have been hard to find a Prince to whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had been more bountiful in thoſe Gifts and Qualities, that are found neceſſary to the acquiſition of Power and Empire: His Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61906:329"/>was clear, his Memory excellent, and his Perſon and Faſhion bore the Majeſty he held; but his brighteſt Vertues were his Reſolution and Military Abilities. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it would be too long a digreſſion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count here how it came to paſs that he loſt this excellent Character, and from a great King became a Tyrant; we will therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr that Story to a more proper place.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> then decamping from <hi>Olympia,</hi> march'd towards <hi>Pharae,</hi> and ſoon after came to <hi>Telphuſſa,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Heraea,</hi> where he caus'd all the Booty to be ſold. Here he order'd a Bridge to be made over the River <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> whereby to facilitate his paſſage into the Territory of the <hi>Tryphalians.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Dorimachus</hi> Praetor of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> ſent ſix hundred of that Nation under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Phylidas,</hi> to the Aid of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> who had demanded Succours againſt thoſe that waſted their Country. <hi>Phylidas</hi> on his arrival joining five hundred Mercenaries to his own Troops, who were liſted into the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Pay, and adding to them a thouſand of the City-Bands, together with certain <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> march'd to the relief of the <hi>Tryphalians.</hi> This Country takes its Name from an <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Boy call'd <hi>Tryphalus:</hi> It ſtands in the Maritime parts of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> between the <hi>Eleans</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> looking towards the <hi>Lybian</hi> Sea, on the skirts of <hi>Achaia</hi> towards the North-Weſt. The Towns of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61906:330"/>are <hi>Samicum, Lepreum, Hypana, Typa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naea, Pyrgus, Aepyum, Bolax, Styllagium,</hi> and <hi>Phryxa.</hi> The <hi>Eleans</hi> having of late days ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd and reduc'd all theſe Places to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to which they added <hi>Alipheraea,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore an <hi>Arcadian</hi> Town; and <hi>Megalopolis</hi> it ſelf, by the procurement of <hi>Alliadas,</hi> while the Soveraignty was in his hand, which was negotiated by way of exchange, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reaſons beſt known to him and the <hi>Eleans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King being now quit of his Plunder and Baggage, paſſing the <hi>Alpheus</hi> which runs by the Walls of <hi>Heraea,</hi> came to <hi>Alipheraea:</hi> This Town is ſeated on an Eminence, which lies ſteep and ſloping every way, being an aſcent of above a Mile to the top, where ſtands a Fortreſs, in which there is a Statue of Braſs of <hi>Minerva,</hi> famous for its Magnitude and the Excellence of the Workmanſhip. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants themſelves can give no very clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why it was there plac'd, nor at whoſe Charge it was done. But as to the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all conclude it to have been wrought by the hands of <hi>Hecatodorus</hi> and <hi>Soſtratus;</hi> and that it is the moſt beautiful and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Piece they ever perform'd. <hi>Philip</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving order'd thoſe who carry'd the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Ladders to be ready by Day-break, at certain places aſſign'd them, ſent his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries before, and to ſuſtain them a Body of <hi>Macedonians,</hi> giving them Orders to begin
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61906:330"/>all together to mount the Hill, at the inſtant the Sun appear'd above the Horizon: Which Directions were punctually and with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution obſerv'd by the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Thoſe of the place haſtening to that part where they ſaw the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in greateſt number, gave the King opportunity at the head of a Party of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Men, to paſs unobſerv'd by thoſe of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, over certain broken Grounds, full of Rocks and Precipices: From whence giving the Signal, they approach'd with their Ladders to mount the Works. <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf firſt enters, and takes poſſeſſion of an unguarded part of the Place, which he immediately ſets in a flame; whereupon thoſe, who were defending the Wall, beholding all on fire, terrify'd at the Danger they ſaw ſo near them, and fearing they ſhould loſe the Citadel, which was their laſt Refuge, forthwith abandon'd the Defence of their Wall, and haſtned thither. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Macedonians</hi> became preſently Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Works and the Town. But thoſe who were retreated to the Citadel, ſoon ſent to the King, and, on compoſition for their Lives, yielded it up. This Succeſs ſpread Fear throughout all the Country of <hi>Tryphalia,</hi> and every one began to deliberate how to preſerve themſelves and ſave their Country.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Phylidas,</hi> he having quitted <hi>Typa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naea,</hi> and committed ſome Spoils on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, retir'd to <hi>Lepreum.</hi> For in thoſe times, the Confederates of the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61906:331"/>tho' in Amity, not only to be by them deſerted in their greateſt ſtraits, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themſelves to be plunder'd and betray'd by them; and endur'd at their hands (who call'd them Friends) all the Outrages that could be fear'd from a conquering Enemy. Thoſe of <hi>Typanaea</hi> gave up their City to King <hi>Philip;</hi> and the <hi>Hypanaeans</hi> follow'd their example. In the mean time, the <hi>Phialians</hi> having underſtood what paſs'd in <hi>Tryphalia,</hi> deteſting the <hi>Aetolian</hi> League, reſolutely took poſſeſſion of the Palace, where the Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchs or Magiſtrates reſided. As to the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Pilferers, who held their abode at <hi>Phialia,</hi> with deſign to ſpoil from thence the Lands of the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> and were at that time conſulting about enterprizing ſomething on the <hi>Phialians</hi> themſelves; when they came to underſtand that the Inhabitants were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to ſtand on their guard, and repel Force by Force, they thereupon chang'd their purpoſe, and after having taken certain Security of thoſe of the Town, they march'd out with all their Baggage; whereupon the <hi>Phialians</hi> diſpatch'd their Deputies to the King, giving their Town and Country up to his diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the <hi>Lepreans</hi> ſeizing a quarter of the Town into their hands, attempted to force out of the Citadel, the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolians, Eleans,</hi> and the Troops that had been ſent to their relief by the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> But
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61906:331"/>
                        <hi>Phylidas</hi> at firſt ſet light by this their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, ſeeming reſolv'd to do his beſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Town in Obedience, and terrifie the Inhabitants. But on <hi>Philip</hi>'s ſending <hi>Taurion</hi> with part of the Army towards <hi>Phia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and himſelf now drawing near, his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage began to ſink; whereupon the <hi>Lepreans</hi> grew more aſſur'd, and did an Action in that occaſion very memorable. For albeit there were at that time in the Town a thouſand <hi>Eleans,</hi> five hundred <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and two hundred <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and the Citadel over and above in their hands; they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Reſolution to enterprize the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of their Country, and would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to betray themſelves by a ſlaviſh Fear or Submiſſion. Wherefore <hi>Phylidas</hi> perceiving the Citizens determination, march'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Eleans</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> out of the Town; as to the <hi>Cretans,</hi> who had been ſent by the <hi>Spartiatae,</hi> they return'd by the way of <hi>Meſſina</hi> to their own Country, and <hi>Phylidas</hi> retreated to <hi>Samicum.</hi> As ſoon as the <hi>Lepreans</hi> became Maſters of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they diſpatch'd their Deputies to <hi>Philip</hi> to make tender of their City, and put it into his hands. After the King had given them Audience, he diſpatch'd a part of his Troops to <hi>Leprea;</hi> and continu'd his march with his Buckler-men, and light-arm'd Troops, being determin'd to attack <hi>Phylidas;</hi> who (with the loſs of all his Plunder and Baggage) was,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61906:332"/>as we ſaid, retreated to <hi>Samicum,</hi> whither the King ſpeedily came, and encamp'd in view of the Place; and ſending This Orders for the reſt of his Troops to join him from <hi>Leprea,</hi> made countenance of reſolving to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it. Whereupon the <hi>Eleans</hi> and <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were unprovided for Defence; and had nothing but the bare Walls to truſt to began to capitulate; ſo it was agreed they ſhould march out with their Arms; from whence they went to <hi>Elea.</hi> Thus the King became Maſter of <hi>Samicum.</hi> And now upon the Supplication of the Towns round about, he receiv'd them all into his Protection; as, namely, <hi>Phryxa, Styllagium, Epia, Bolax, Pyrga,</hi> and <hi>Epitalia,</hi> and ſo march'd back to <hi>Leprea,</hi> having in the ſpace of ſix Days com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd the Reduction of all <hi>Tryphalia</hi> to his Obedience.</p>
                     <p>After ſome Conference with the <hi>Lepreans,</hi> ſuiting the time and occaſion, he put a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon into the Citadel, and led his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Heraea,</hi> leaving <hi>Ladicus</hi> the <hi>Acarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> his Governour in <hi>Tryphalia.</hi> Upon his arrival at <hi>Heraea,</hi> he order'd the Booty to be divided and diſtributed to the Soldiers; and after he had victual'd the Army, and ſupply'd himſelf with all things neceſſary, he departed from <hi>Heraea,</hi> being then mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winter, and march'd towards <hi>Megalopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:61906:332"/>
                     <p>While Succeſs thus waited on the Arms of King <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Tryphalia, Chilon</hi> the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian,</hi> conceiving the Right of Succeſſion to the Crown to be in him, and not longer able to ſuffer the Injury that had been done him by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> (who in his wrong had preferr'd <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to the Royalty) was determin'd to attempt ſomething towards doing himſelf Juſtice. Wherefore being perſuaded he ſhould win much on the People, if by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> (and many others) he gave them hopes of a new diviſion of the Lands; he by that means meditated how to put his Enterprize in effect. After he had imparted his purpoſe then to his Friends, whereof there were no leſs than two hundred, who engag'd in the Conſpiracy, he reſolv'd to loſe no time. But foraſmuch as he well knew, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and the <hi>Ephori</hi> who had elected him, were the main Impediment, he firſt attack'd them, and ſurprizing the <hi>Ephori</hi> as they ſat at Table, kill'd them there. Thus did Fortune bring thoſe Men to ſuffer what their Practices had demerited; for whether we conſider either the Actor, or the Action, it cannot but be confeſs'd their end was juſt. After they had diſpatch'd the <hi>Ephori, Chilon</hi> haſtens to the Houſe of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> but chanc'd there to be diſappointed; he, by the help of his Friends and Servants being ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd away, making his eſcape to <hi>Pellene,</hi> by private ways, unknown to his Enemy. And
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61906:333"/>now tho' <hi>Chilon</hi> fail'd of effecting the moſt important part of his Enterprize, and had but an indifferent proſpect of Succeſs; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he was under a neceſſity of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting what he had began. Wherefore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Market-place, he there attacks and kills all he could find, whom he knew to be his Enemies; greatly animating his Friends and Relations, and giving ſome hopes to the Multitude. But beholding at length when he had done all, that few or none took part with him; on the contrary finding himſelf in danger, he ſecretly withdrew and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; taking his way through the Territory of <hi>Laconia,</hi> and ſo eſcap'd into <hi>Achaia,</hi> when he liv'd as a baniſh'd Man.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> apprehending the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of King <hi>Philip,</hi> ſecur'd their Effects in the Country, ſlighted <hi>Athenaeum</hi> of the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> and diſmantled the Works.</p>
                     <p>Thus the People of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who had long liv'd in the injoyment of ſo excellent a form of Government, from the time that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> gave them their Laws; and who held ſo great a ſhare of Power and Reputation till the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their Reputation diminiſh'd every day inteſtine jarrs vex'd and tormented them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of dividing their Lands, till is the end they were brought ſo low as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Tyranny of <hi>Nabis,</hi> who heretofore
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61906:333"/>could not brook to hear ſo much as the Name of Tyrant. But enough has been ſaid by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the ſubject of the ancient <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> and their Actions, and every Body knows what befel them, as ſoon as <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had ſubverted the eſtabliſh'd Laws and Form of their Republick; nor ſhall we omit to make further mention of them as occaſion ſhall be given. From <hi>Megalopolis Philip</hi> march'd his Troops by the way of <hi>Tegaea</hi> to <hi>Argos,</hi> where he paſs'd the remainder of the Winter; having acquir'd a Reputation much greater than his Age promis'd, through the many, noble, and early Actions he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perform'd. In the mean time, <hi>Apelles</hi> (of whom we have already ſpoken) had not ſo given over his Project as to be without hopes, as was plainly ſeen, of bringing by degrees the <hi>Achaians</hi> Necks to the Yoke. But he well knew that <hi>Aratus,</hi> both Father and Son, withſtood his Deſign, and that the King held them in ſingular eſteem, eſpecially the Father, who had been in great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and was known to be a very powerful Man among the <hi>Achaians;</hi> and the King himſelf, I ſay, valu'd him for his Prudence and great Abilities. Wherefore <hi>Apelles</hi> reſolv'd to attack theſe two, and by fraud and addreſs do his beſt to ruine them with King <hi>Philip.</hi> Purſuant to which, he firſt carefully informs himſelf of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all who among the <hi>Achaians</hi> were
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61906:334"/>of the oppoſite Faction; and being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in their ſeveral Intereſts and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, he ſends for them to Court; and on their Arrival, employs all his Arts to win and engage them to his Friendſhip, acting in their Favour with the King, whom he labour'd to perſuade, That if he continu'd to treat the <hi>Aratuſes</hi> with ſo much Deference, he could never hope to gain any thing on the <hi>Achaians,</hi> further than what was ſtipulated by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Confederacy. But if he ſhould pleaſe to countenance and encourage thoſe he ſhould recommend, he would ſoon compaſs whatever he deſir'd, and diſpoſe of all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> at his pleaſure. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the time of Election of their Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor drawing nigh, he reſolv'd to do his beſt to conferr that Dignity on one of his own Party, and to diminiſh by all means poſſible the Power of the <hi>Aratuſes</hi> Adminiſtration, as being in no wiſe proper for his uſe in the Part he had to act; whereupon he prevail'd with the King to go as it were in Progreſs to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> and to be preſent at the <hi>Achaian</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. So <hi>Philip</hi> follow'd his Counſel, and fail'd not to be there in due time; where <hi>Apelles</hi> by Threats on the one hand, and Perſuaſion on the other, compaſs'd with great difficulty the Election of <hi>Eperatus</hi> the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> to the Praetorſhip, in preference to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moxenus,</hi> who had been ſet up by <hi>Aratus.</hi>

                     <p>Soon after, the King departed from <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> marching the Army towards <hi>Patroe</hi> and <hi>Dymas,</hi> and came to the Fortreſs of <hi>Tichos,</hi> which ſtands on the Borders of the <hi>Dymaeans,</hi> and whereof, as hath been elſewhere obſerv'd, <hi>Euripidas</hi> had been long before poſſeſs'd. The King then being very deſirous to win back this Caſtle, and reſtore it to the <hi>Dymaeans,</hi> encamp'd with the whole Army by it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Elean</hi> Garriſon within became ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd, that they quickly deliver'd it up. This place, tho' but ſmall, is exceeding ſtrong; it is not in circuit above a Furlong, but the Walls are not leſs than five and fifty Foot high. So the King reſtor'd it to the <hi>Dymae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and then led his Army into the Country of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> waſting and plundering far and wide; and after he had loaden the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with Booty, return'd back to <hi>Dymas-Apelles,</hi> who began now to think he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd far in his Enterprize; having obtain'd an <hi>Achaian</hi> Praetor of his Faction, he renew'd his Attempts on the <hi>Aratuſes,</hi> being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd totally to deſtroy their Intereſt with the King. He purſu'd them then with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, which he thus manag'd: <hi>Amphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> chief of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> who had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner at <hi>Thalamé,</hi> (whither he was retir'd, as hath been told) being brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others to <hi>Olympia,</hi> ſo wrought by the mediation of Friends, that he was admitted to a Conference with the King; in which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61906:335"/>Audience he perſuaded him, That it would be no difficult matter to procure him the Friendſhip of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> and that he well knew by what means to effect it, and make that People covet his Alliance. The King being wrought to believe him, forthwith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd him without Ranſom; impow'ring him to aſſure the <hi>Eleans,</hi> That on condition of their ent'ring into League with him, all their Priſoners ſhould be enlarg'd Ranſom-free: That he would protect their Country from Plunder, and all the waſteful effects of War, and confirm and preſerve their rightful Liberties, ſo as they ſhould live in the entire enjoyment of all their Privileges, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt both from Garriſons and Tribute. And now albeit theſe Overtures contain'd ſo much favour, and might be thought ſufficient to engage them; nevertheleſs the <hi>Eleans</hi> would not be drawn to liſten to them, but remain'd immovable.</p>
                     <p>This incidence arm'd <hi>Apelles</hi> with Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againſt the <hi>Aratuſes,</hi> who charg'd them with Inſincerity to the King, and that they did not, as they ought, ſerve the Intereſt of the League in which they were engag'd with the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> telling the King, if the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> had ſhewn any averſion to his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it was wholly due to the Artifices of the <hi>Aratuſes:</hi> That, in ſhort, upon <hi>Amphido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>'s departure from <hi>Olympia</hi> towards <hi>Elis,</hi> they took an occaſion to have Conference
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61906:335"/>with him, and ſo prevail'd, that he became of another Mind, and chang'd his Purpoſe; being by them perſuaded, That it would be in no wiſe for the Intereſt of the <hi>Peloponneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that King <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould acquire any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the <hi>Eleans;</hi> and that this was the cauſe why the <hi>Eleans</hi> receiv'd the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals ſo coldly, and perſiſted in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and endur'd ſo patiently the Miſchiefs they ſuffer'd from the <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Philip</hi> had heard theſe things, he order'd the two <hi>Aratuſes</hi> to be ſent for, to the end he might confront them with their Accuſer, who ſhould be oblig'd to charge them to their Faces with theſe Matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had been accus'd to him in private. Whereupon they came and heard what <hi>Apelles</hi> had to ſay; who charg'd them roundly and with great aſſurance, and a Countenance full of Menaces; adding, in the King's Preſence (who had not yet ſpoken) That ſince the King had diſcover'd their Ingratitude to him, and that they had render'd themſelves ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his good Offices, he had therefore deliberated on calling an Aſſembly of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians,</hi> to whom he would impart the Cauſe, and then return with his Army into <hi>Macedon.</hi> Whereupon the elder <hi>Aratus</hi> reply'd, praying the King not over-haſtily to give credit to what he heard; and that whenſoever he ſhould ſtand accus'd of any Matters to him, by any
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61906:336"/>Friend or Ally, he would vouchſafe to fift<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and examine every thing with Caution, before he came to believe a Calumnious Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him: That furthermore, as it became the Juſtice of a Prince ſo to do, ſo the thing in it ſelf was advantageous to him: That in the mean time, it would be but fair-dealing in <hi>Apelles</hi> to cauſe thoſe Perſons to be produc'd who were Witneſſes to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, whereof he had been accus'd, and the Perſon likewiſe himſelf who had given <hi>Apelles</hi> the Information: That, in ſhort, nothing ought to be omitted, whereby the King might arrive at the certain Truth of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before he ſhould determine to diſcover any thing thereof in the Aſſembly of the <hi>Achaians.</hi> The King became of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Mind; and reply'd, That he would not in any wiſe reſolve haſtily, but would carefully firſt inform himſelf in every particular of the Matter; and thereupon diſmiſs'd the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Not long after this Controverſie (over and above that <hi>Apelles</hi> never produc'd any Proof of the Accuſation) a chance happen'd, which greatly favour'd the Cauſe of <hi>Aratus. Amphidamus</hi> falling under ſuſpicion of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> about the Time <hi>Philip</hi> was waſting their Country, they had therefore form'd a Deſign to ſecure his Perſon, and ſending him Priſoner to the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> But he having ſome ſuſpicion of their Purpoſe, withdrew himſelf, and eſcap'd firſt to <hi>Olympia;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61906:336"/>being inform'd, that the King intended to remain ſome Days at <hi>Dymas,</hi> where he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Booty, he departed from thence, and came thither to him. <hi>Aratus</hi> was well pleas'd with the Eſcape and Arrival of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidamus;</hi> he therefore with the aſſurance of an innocent Man, pray'd the King to order him to be brought to his Preſence, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controverſie would be beſt able of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers rightly to inform him, he being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Perſon to whom the Secret was ſaid to be imparted, adding, That there could be no doubt of his Sincerity in the Relation he ſhould give, conſidering he had been compell'd now to abandon his Country on the ſcore of the King, and had no other recourſe but to him. This Requeſt of <hi>Aratus</hi> was thought but reaſonable; wherefore <hi>Amphidamus</hi> was brought to the King, by whom the untruth of the Accuſation was made to appear. This prov'd the occaſion that the Good will of King <hi>Philip</hi> grew now more and more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Aratus,</hi> whom he held in very great conſideration; and, on the contrary, of his change towards <hi>Apelles,</hi> whom he came by degrees to diſlike: Howbeit, he diſſembled that and many other things all he could, through the long poſſeſſion of Power he had acquir'd with him.</p>

                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Apelles</hi> neglects not to purſue his Deſign, prevailing to have <hi>Taurion,</hi> who was Governour for the King in <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> to be remov'd from that Truſt; not by any Accuſation he preferr'd againſt him, but more artfully by praiſing his Abilities, and that it was for the King's better Service to have him preſent with him in his Wars and Expeditions; when his meaning was, to have it in his Power to provide a Governour of his own ſtamp in <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> Thus by this new way are Praiſes converted into Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Men are undone by Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Furthermore, <hi>Apelles</hi> took all occaſions to diminiſh the Credit of <hi>Alexander</hi> with the King, who had the Command of his Guards, to the end he might have it in his Power likewiſe to diſpoſe of that Place, and, to conclude all in a word, bent his utmoſt Endeavours to introduce a total Change in the eſtabliſh'd Order of Government, which had been left by <hi>Antigonus;</hi> tho' that Prince, while he liv'd, rul'd the Kingdom and the young King with great Wiſdom, and at his Death provided as wiſely for every thing. For in his Will he left his Reaſons to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> of the whole Method of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and laid down Rules and Preſcriptions for their future Government; appointing to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61906:338"/>whom the adminiſtration of Affairs ſhould be committed; and aiming by all means poſſible ſo to ſettle the Kingdom, as to leave no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Diſſention or Diſcord among the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and others, whom they ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy. Wherefore he nominated <hi>Apelles</hi> for one of the young King's Tutors, who at that time was jointly truſted with him in other Matters. To <hi>Leontius</hi> he gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Buckler-men; <hi>Megalea</hi> was made Secretary; <hi>Taurion</hi> was appointed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had the Command of the King's Guards.</p>
                     <p>But in concluſion, <hi>Megalea</hi> and <hi>Leontius</hi> being Creatures of <hi>Apelles,</hi> he diſpos'd them as he pleas'd, and therefore ſet all his Arts at work to remove <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Taurion</hi> from Authority, that himſelf might have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or execute it by inſtruments of his own; all which Deſigns, he had in great likelihood brought to paſs had he not engag'd in that ſecret War with <hi>Aratus.</hi> Wherefore he came at length to feel the ſmart of his Folly; and reap'd the Wages of his Ambition; it being his Lot to ſuffer thoſe Evils he was preparing for others.

                     <p>As to King <hi>Philip,</hi> he coming to want Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Proviſions for his Army, had convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by their Magiſtrates the Aſſembly of the <hi>Achainas;</hi> which according to cuſtom was held at <hi>Aegium.</hi> Where perceiving <hi>Aratus</hi> (ill ſatisfy'd with the Practices of <hi>Apelles</hi>) had willingly reſign'd his Authority; and finding <hi>Eperatus</hi> unqualify'd for buſineſs, and in no eſteem with the People, he came at length to diſcern the foul play of <hi>Apelles</hi> and <hi>Leontius,</hi> which renew'd his eſteem for <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> whom he now conſider'd more than ever. Not long after, having prevail'd with the Magiſtrates, that their next Convention ſhould be at <hi>Sicyon,</hi> he there had private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the two <hi>Aratus</hi>'s; and imputing all that had paſs'd to the Artifices of <hi>Apelles,</hi> pray'd them to forget their Wrongs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue him in the ſame degree of Affection as heretofore. Whereupon coming to a new Accord, the King went to the Aſſembly,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61906:340"/>where without difficulty he obtain'd by their procurement all he defir'd towards the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of his Affairs. The <hi>Achaians</hi> then decreed, That as ſoon as the Army ſhould begin to march, fifty Talents ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the King, being three Months pay to the Army; together with Ten Thouſand Meaſures of Corn. And it was alſo further reſolv'd, That while the King made War in Perſon in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> he ſhould receive ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Talents Monthly. After theſe Acts of the Aſſembly they ſeparated, and retir'd to their reſpective Cities.</p>
                     <p>And now, when the Army began to move from their Winter-Quarters, it was reſolv'd by the King in Council, to proſecute the War likewiſe by Sea; concluding it to be the only means whereby to ſurprize and attack the Enemy from all Quarters, by making deſcents and invading them, where their Towns were diſtant and remote from Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; whereby every one would be oblig'd to conſult their own ſingle Safety through the uncertainty of their Motions, and it would be in their power to carry their Arms with more caſe, whitherſoever they ſhould judge it moſt expedient; for they had to do at once with the <hi>Aetolians, Lacedaemonians,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans.</hi> After this had been reſolv'd, the King order'd the Fleet, both his own and the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Ships to Rendezvous at the Port of <hi>Lechoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> where he commanded the Soldiers of the

                     <p>While King <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> remain'd at <hi>Corinth,</hi> employ'd about their Naval Preparations; <hi>Apelles</hi> who could not brook the diminution of his Credit, nor work any change in the Mind of his Maſter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into Compact with <hi>Leontius</hi> and <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas;</hi> with whom it was agreed, that they, on their part, who were to act in the Army about the King, ſhould labour with their beſt Arts ſecretly to thwart and obſtruct him in all his Deſigns; while he making his abode at <hi>Chalcis,</hi> would take care ſo to ſhorten and retard his Supplies of every thing from all Parts, that he ſhould be ſo ſtreighten'd on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61906:341"/>that ſide, that the want of Neceſſaries to the advancing his Expeditions ſhould be a great impediment to his Progreſs. After Matters had been thus concerted between them, this crafty old Courtier ſoon found reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſpoſe the King to approve of his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> whither he went; and where he perform'd Articles ſo punctually with the other two, that he brought the King under ſuch ſtreights, that he became conſtrain'd to pawn his Plate to ſupply his Wants. As ſoon as the Naval Army was drawn together, and it was thought the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exercis'd, and inſtructed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Oar; the King, cauſing Bread and Pay to be diſtributed to the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, embark'd with Six Thouſand <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and Twelve Hundred Mercenaries, and ſteer'd his Courſe towards <hi>Patroe,</hi> where he arriv'd the next Day after his departure from <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the ſame time <hi>Dorimachus</hi> the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Praetor diſpatch'd <hi>Agelaus</hi> and <hi>Scopas</hi> with Five Hundred new rais'd <hi>Candiots</hi> to the Aid of the <hi>Eleans.</hi> For theſe being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome apprehenſion that the King had ſome deſign on <hi>Cyllene,</hi> had taken Foreign Troops into their Pay, and levied others of their own Subjects, and took care to Fortify and Garriſon that Place. Wherefore <hi>Philip</hi> compoſing a Body of all the Stranger-Troops, of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> the <hi>Candiots</hi> that were with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61906:342"/>him, ſome <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Horſe, and Two Thouſand choice <hi>Achaian</hi> Foot, put them into <hi>Dyma;</hi> both for a reſerve, if occaſion ſhould require, and to ſtrengthen and ſecure that Place in caſe the <hi>Eleans</hi> ſhould have a mind to attempt any thing that way. Then ſending his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches to the <hi>Meſſenians, Epirots, Acarnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> requiring them to haſten with their Ships, and meet him at <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalenia,</hi> he parted from <hi>Patroe</hi> at a Day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd, and came to <hi>Pronos</hi> a Port of that Iſland. Where obſerving the very great difficulty of ſucceeding by laying ſiege to that Place, the Country about it being very ſtreight, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further, and ſteer'd towards the Town of <hi>Palé:</hi> Here finding plenty of Corn on the Ground whereby to ſuſtain his Army, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embark'd, and ſat down before that Place, drawing his Veſſels aſhoar, and ſecuring them with a good Ditch and Paliſſado, he ſent out his <hi>Macedonians</hi> to Forage, while he approach'd to view the Place, whereby to make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he might beſt apply his Engines to the Walls; it being his purpoſe there to attend the coming of the Confederate Forces, and to become Maſter of that Place, thereby to deprive the <hi>Aetolians</hi> of the Benefit it yielded them: For whenever they had any deſign of making a Deſcent on <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> or to plunder the Coaſt of <hi>Epirus</hi> or <hi>Acarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> they made uſe of the Veſſels of <hi>Cephalenia.</hi> Furthermore, he conſider'd this Town would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61906:342"/>make a ſafe retreat both for himſelf and Friends, and be of great uſe to them in all their Attempts on the Enemy on that ſide. For <hi>Cephalenia</hi> ſtands not far from the Gulf of <hi>Corinth,</hi> looking likewiſe toward the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea, and that part of the Coaſt of <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſus,</hi> that lies North and North-Weſt; and is in the Neighbourhood chiefly of the <hi>Epirots, Eleans, Aetolians,</hi> and <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> whoſe Coaſt trends away Weſt and South-Weſt.</p>
                     <p>This Town then lying ſo commodiouſly for aſſembling the Forces of the Confederates, for annoying the Enemy, and protecting of Friends and Allies; the King was therefore very deſirous to get the Iſland into his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. After he had well conſider'd that a great part of the Town was inviron'd by the Sea, and by Rocks that were inacceſſible, and that there was but one ſmall ſpot of good Ground lying towards the way of <hi>Zacinthus,</hi> whereby they might approach, he therefore reſolv'd there to apply his Engines, and make that the principal Attack. In the mean time, there join'd him fifteen Veſſels ſent by <hi>Scer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilaidas;</hi> for the Commotions that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in <hi>Illyria</hi> among the Governours of thoſe Provinces, who had fallen into dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſſentions among themſelves, was the cauſe he could not ſend a greater Supply, Aids came likewiſe from the <hi>Epirots, Acarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians;</hi> for after the taking
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61906:343"/>of <hi>Phialea,</hi> the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> readily took their ſhare of the War.</p>
                     <p>And now, when all things were prepar'd, and the Machines for caſting of Stones and Darts in a readineſs, the King order'd them to approach the Walls, after he had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd his own People, and had began to ſap their Works. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> then who wrought chearfully at the Work, had ſoon undermin'd a great part of the Wall, ſtrongly ſuſtaining the Burthen with great Poſts of Wood as they proceeded, whereupon the King ſummon'd the Town to ſurrender: But they having no diſpoſition to ſubmit, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Fire to be apply'd to the Props that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd the Wall, whereupon a Breach was quickly made. Then he order'd the Buckler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were under the Command of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius,</hi> (dividing them into Parties) to march to the Attack, and enter the Town over the Ruines of the Breach. But <hi>Leontius,</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Agreement he had made with <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> with-held certain forward Men, who were already advanc'd to the top of the Breach from proceeding any further. And having before corrupted ſome of the principal Officers of the Army, and acting his own part but coldly, it came to paſs, that after great loſs of their Men, they were beaten off, when they had the faireſt opportunity that could be wiſh'd of taking the Town.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61906:343"/>of his Officers, and that the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had much ſuffer'd in this Attack, he rais'd the Siege, calling a Council to debate what was beſt next to be done.</p>
                     <p>While King <hi>Philip</hi> was thus buſie here, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> march'd with an Army into the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> and <hi>Dorimachus</hi> with part of the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Forces into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> both with the ſame deſign of obliging the King to raiſe the Siege. Whereupon Ambaſſadors were diſpatch'd to him from the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians.</hi> Thoſe from <hi>Acarnania</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his falling on the Lands of the <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> ſo to compel <hi>Dorimachus,</hi> by ſpoiling the Country, to return to their relief. But the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> pray'd preſent Succours; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, That now while the <hi>Eteſian</hi> Winds blew, they might in a Day's fail gain their paſſage from <hi>Cephalenia</hi> to the Coaſt of <hi>Meſſenia;</hi> where <hi>Gorgus</hi> the <hi>Meſſenian</hi> was of Opinion, they might endanger the ſurprizing of <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and that the Enterprize promis'd great advantage. <hi>Leontius,</hi> who ſaw this Counſel tended to his purpoſe, ſtrongly ſeconded the Advice, foreſeeing that if the King follow'd it, he would ſpend the whole Summer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, it was true, that to <hi>Meſſenia</hi> 'twas a ſhort and eaſie paſſage, but it was impoſſible to return back during the ſeaſon of thoſe Winds; ſo that in all probability ſhould the King have follow'd that Advice, he would
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61906:344"/>have been ſhut up in <hi>Meſſenia</hi> during the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Action, without doing any thing to the purpoſe, while the <hi>Aetolians</hi> would be at liberty to ſpoil at their eaſe, and put all to Fire and Sword in <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Epirus.</hi> This Counſel therefore was very pernicious; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aratus</hi> labour'd to divert the King, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much better it was to fall on the <hi>Aetolians</hi> by Sea, and that the occaſion of making Deſcents with their Fleet was not to be loſt, now that <hi>Dorimachus</hi> with the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Forces was diverted elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>The King, who had already conceiv'd a doubtful Opinion of <hi>Leontius,</hi> as well through his late Behaviour in the Siege, as by other grounds of ſuſpicion he had given him of his Fidelity, became inclin'd to follow the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Aratus:</hi> Whereupon he writ to <hi>Epera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the <hi>Achaian</hi> Praetor to aſſemble his Troops, and march to the relief of the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> while he himſelf weighing Anchor the next Day, gain'd his paſſage under covert of the Night from <hi>Cephalenia</hi> to <hi>Leucas;</hi> where all things having been duly prepar'd at the <hi>Iſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> of <hi>Dioryctus,</hi> he caus'd his Veſſels to be drawn over, and ſo paſs'd into the Gulf of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> which, as we have obſerv'd, comes out of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Sea, and runs far up into the Country of <hi>Aetolia.</hi> Having perform'd this Journey ſomewhat before Day, he made ſail towards a Town call'd <hi>Limnoea:</hi> Here cauſing the Army to take a ſhort refreſhment,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61906:344"/>and to be in a readineſs to march, and to take no Baggage with them but what they could not be without; and having procur'd ſtore of good Guides, he became exactly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by them of the nature and ſituation of the Country and Towns, and inſtructed in every thing he had a mind to know.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Ariſtophontus</hi> the <hi>Acarnanian</hi> Praetor came to the King, at the head of all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that People; for having been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great Sufferers by the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> they came with Minds full of Revenge, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay them in their own Coin. Wherefore they embrac'd the occaſion with great joy of being thus aſſiſted by the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> ſo that not only ſuch as by the Law were oblig'd to go to the War, but thoſe who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted by their Age, liſted themſelves for this Expedition. The <hi>Epirots</hi> incited by the like Motives, were not leſs forward; tho' by reaſon of the great extent of their Country, and the ſudden arrival of King <hi>Philip,</hi> they were not ſo well able to draw their Troops together. <hi>Dorimachus,</hi> as was noted, had led with him the one half of the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Forces, leaving the other half at home, which he conceiv'd would be ſtrength ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any ſudden occaſion, and be guard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Towns and the Country.

The Army remain'd that Night in the Town, loaden with all ſorts of Plunder, and in the Morning, chuſing out what was moſt valuable and eaſie to be tranſported, they made an heap of the reſt, and burnt it before the Camp.

                     <p>Hitherto their Proceedings were but juſt, and the War fairly made, but whether what they did afterwards will bear that Name, is a doubt: For calling to mind what the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> had done at <hi>Dium</hi> and <hi>Dodona,</hi> they were provok'd not only to burn and deſtroy the Portico's of the Temple and all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, which were wrought with great Art and Expence.

Furthermore, they caſt down all the Statues to the number of two thouſand, defacing and breaking in pieces the greateſt part of thoſe that were not conſecrated to, or erected in repreſentation of the Gods. While to theſe they reſerv'd a Reſpect, ingraving on certain Stones thoſe Verſes, that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo much ſpoken of, being written by <hi>Samus</hi> Son of <hi>Chryſogonus,</hi> who had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

Nor was it his manner to give the Reigns to his Indignation in time of Hoſtility, nor to purſue his Enemies by Arms any longer than till he had gotten it in his Power to make them Examples of his Clemency. Thus by reſtoring the <hi>Athenian</hi> Priſoners without Ranſom; by giving decent Burial to thoſe that were ſlain, and ſending their Bones by <hi>Antipater</hi> to <hi>Athens;</hi> and, in a word, by Clothing many of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home, he gave an eaſie Period to a moſt difficult Enterprize.

                        </gap> Examples, whereby to give proof, that he did not ſucceed theſe his glorious Anceſtors leſs in Magnanimity, than in State and Authority. But, in ſhort, he labour'd all his Life long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give proofs of his being deſcended from <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> but too little care to imitate their Vertues. Wherefore as his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had no reſemblance with thoſe of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, ſo his Reputation fell likewiſe ſhort of that which they had acquir'd. And it was viſible by what he did at that time; for his Indignation againſt the <hi>Aetolians</hi> wrought him to act the ſame Outrages he would be thought to puniſh; and, as the Saying is, to remedy one Evil with another; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd himſelf in the right, when he did no more than repay them meaſure for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: And while he himſelf incurr'd the ſame Guilt, to revenge the Sacrileges of <hi>Dorima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Scopas,</hi> dream'd not that he ſhould fall under the ſame Imputation, and ſhare the like Infamy. For to do our utmoſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61906:348"/>an Enemy of his Fortreſſes, Towns and Ports; and, in ſhort, of all that can be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call'd their own; and even to purſue to deſtruction both them and theirs, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs Succeſs to our Enterprizes, is not accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Criminal, or againſt the Law of Arms, which compel to ſuch Violences. But to act ſuch Parts as are neither profitable to our ſelves, nor a weakning to the Enemy; ſuch as caſting down and defacing of Statues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of Temples, and ſpoiling the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Who can reckon this other than Rage, and the effect of Madneſs? In a word, it is the Office of a Man of Honour, tho' in Hoſtility with the vileſt Enemy, to purſue them no further than the Correction of their Faults, and the Reparation of the Injuries they have ſuſtain'd. To diſtinguiſh between the Innocent and the Guilty, and not involve them in the ſame Puniſhment; and when he cannot diſcriminate between them, he ought to preſerve the Guilty for the ſake of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. For 'tis the Property of a Tyrant to be ever acting Miſchief, and to Reign by Violence; to hate his Subjects out of Fear, and be deteſted by them. While 'tis the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a King, to be Beneficent to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to acquire the Love of his Subjects by Clemency and Acts of Grace, and ſo to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Minds, that he ſhall not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to reign, than they to be govern'd.</p>

                     <p>But it may be objected, That this Errour was not entirely due to <hi>Philip,</hi> who was then but young, but ought principally to be aſcrib'd to the Counſels of thoſe about him; of which number were <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian:</hi> But it will not be hard to determine which of thoſe two was likelieſt to give ſuch Advice, albeit he had not been then preſent at Council: For it will be no-where found in the whole Life of <hi>Aratus,</hi> that he ever acted any thing temerariouſly, and without ſolid Deliberation; while, on the contrary, <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> never did any thing but with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And we ſhall ſhew, and plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by their Behaviour in the like Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, the difference of the Minds and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of theſe two Men, as occaſion ſhall be given us.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our Story: <hi>Philip</hi> taking with him all that could conveniently be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, march'd from <hi>Therme</hi> by the way he came. The Booty he order'd to go in the Van, guarded by his heavy-arm'd Troops: The Reer guard was aſſign'd to the <hi>Acarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and mercenary Strangers, being himſelf extreamly ſolicitous to get his paſſage through the <hi>Streights</hi> with what expedition he could, thereby to prevent the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Strength of thoſe Faſtneſſes, were likely enough to attempt their Reer in their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61906:350"/>march: Which, in ſhort, came to paſs; for aſſembling to the number of about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, under the leading of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Trichonian,</hi> they let the Van of the Army march without approaching, concealing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves while the <hi>Macedonians</hi> kept the open Field: But as ſoon as the Reer began to move, they march'd into <hi>Therme,</hi> and fell on and charg'd them roundly, inſomuch that they put their Reer-Ranks into great diſorder; which the <hi>Aetolians</hi> perceiving, and favour'd by the advantage of Ground, preſs'd them ſo much the more, killing many. But <hi>Philip</hi> in foreſight of what might happen, had order'd a Detachment of <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and ſome of his beſt Buckler-men, to be lodg'd in ambuſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of a riſing Ground; who unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly appearing, fell on the Enemy, who had now charg'd beyond them, killing above a hundred of them, and taking as many Pris'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; the reſt ſav'd themſelves by flight among the Rocks and Woods.</p>
                     <p>After this repulſe, thoſe who march'd in the Reer of the Army, ſet fire to <hi>Pamphion;</hi> and having paſs'd the Strait, join'd the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> again. <hi>Philip</hi> in the mean time encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping near <hi>Metapa,</hi> to attend their coming up; and the next Day, after he had order'd the Place to be demoliſh'd, he purſu'd his march, and came and encamp'd near a Town call'd <hi>Acras;</hi> from whence departing the next day, he pillag'd the Country all along as he went till he came to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope,</hi> where he remain'd a day to refreſh his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61906:350"/>and then continu'd his march'd towards <hi>Stratus,</hi> along the River <hi>Achelous;</hi> where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping out of ſhot of their Works, on an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence that commands the Town, he from thence vex'd and moleſted the Inhabitants. But coming to underſtand that the Enemy had ſtrengthen'd the Garriſon with a Recruit of Three Thouſand <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Candiots;</hi> and none daring to adventure out againſt him, he decamp'd and march'd to <hi>Limnoea,</hi> purpoſing from thence to imbark. Nevertheleſs, as ſoon as the Reer of the Army began to move, and was gotten ſome diſtance paſt the Town, a Party of <hi>Aetolian</hi> Horſe made a Sally, and charg'd them; theſe being back'd by the <hi>Candiots,</hi> and more <hi>Aetolians</hi> that came out to ſuſtain them, compell'd thoſe in the Reer-guard to face about and make head. At firſt it was an equal Diſpute; but as ſoon as the <hi>Illyrians</hi> came in to back the Mercenaries, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> began to give Ground, and the Horſe betook them to ſlight, and were purſu'd to the very Gates of the Town, and at leaſt a Hundred of them kill'd on the ſpot. After this Repulſe, thoſe of the Town adventur'd no more out; and the Reer of the Army mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Here King <hi>Philip</hi> having commodiouſly Encamp'd the Army, ſacrific'd to the Gods, and did other Acts of Devotion for the good ſucceſs of that Expedition, and at the ſame time gave his Officers a Royal Entertainment.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61906:351"/>In ſhort, his Attempt was look'd on by all Men to have been very daring, to adventure as he did among thoſe dangerous and untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd places, which no Army had ever done before. Nevertheleſs, he ſucceeded in his Enterprize, marching and returning in ſafety, after he had throughly executed what he had deſign'd. Wherefore to expreſs his Joy, he made a ſolemn Feaſt for his Officers; where <hi>Megaleas</hi> and <hi>Leontius,</hi> who had been much diſappointed, and look'd with an evil Eye on the good Fortune of their Maſter, having, as we have heard, complotted with <hi>Apelles</hi> to give him all the Impediments they ſhould be able, but could by no means prevent the good Fortune which attended his Arms, were however preſent; tho' their Behaviour there expreſs'd ſo much diſtaſte, that it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerv'd by the King, and thoſe about him; who thereby collected, that they had diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sentiments from the reſt, touching the proſperity of his Affairs. And now, when all were well warm'd with Wine, <hi>Megaleas</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius</hi> being oblig'd to do as others did, came at length more openly to manifeſt their Minds; for being now drunk, they went from place to place in ſearch of <hi>Aratus;</hi> and meeting him as he was returning from the Feaſt, they firſt attack'd him with rude Language, and afterwards came to offer violence. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tumult aroſe, and the Soldiers came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them from all Quarters, inſomuch as the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61906:351"/>whole Camp was in diſorder. The King, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice hereof, immediately ſent to appeaſe the Tumult, and to have an account how it happen'd: Where after <hi>Aratus</hi> had reported to him how every thing had paſs'd, and had vouch'd it by the Teſtimony of ſuch as were preſent, he retir'd to his Tent. <hi>Leontius,</hi> having in the mean time conceal'd himſelf in the Crowd, privately withdrew.</p>
                     <p>The King being now fully inform'd of every thing, commanded <hi>Megaleas</hi> and <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> to be brought before him, whom he very ſeverely reprov'd: But they were not only not humbled and made ſenſible of their Fault, but adding Inſolence to their Error, plainly told the King, That they ſhould not be drawn to change their Mind, till they had been tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly reveng'd on <hi>Aratus.</hi> Whereupon the King, greatly mov'd at this their Behaviour, immediately condemn'd them in a Fine of twenty Talents each, and put them under an Arreſt; and ſending the next Day for <hi>Aratus,</hi> expreſs'd his ſenſe of the violence which had been offer'd him, giving him aſſurance of his Protection, and that he would take due care to do him right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leontius</hi> being inform'd how the King had proceeded with <hi>Megaleas,</hi> came boldly to him, accompanied with a Party of his Buckler-men, thinking thereby to put him into ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, he being yet but young, and to awe him into another Reſolution touching the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61906:352"/>Offenders; wherefore he boldly demanded of him, who it was that had preſum'd to lay hands on <hi>Megaleas,</hi> and caſt him into Priſons? But when the King firmly reply'd, and with an Aſſurance worthy of Himſelf, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever had been done, was by his expreſs Command, <hi>Leontius</hi> was confounded, and betwixt Grief and Indignation retir'd from his Preſence.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Philip</hi> embark'd, and arriv'd with his Fleet ſoon after at <hi>Leucas;</hi> where when he had directed thoſe who had the charge of dividing the Booty to haſten the diſtribution thereof: He aſſembled his Council, and fell to debate about the Affairs of <hi>Megaleas;</hi> where <hi>Aratus</hi> charg'd him, and the reſt of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with all thoſe criminal Practices we have noted. He farther laid to their charge the Murther that had been committed after the departure of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and opened the whole Matter of the Conſpiracy of <hi>Apelles,</hi> ſhewing in what manner they had obſtructed the King's Buſineſs in the ſiege of <hi>Palaea.</hi> And foraſmuch as he urg'd nothing againſt them that was not vouch'd by ſolid Reaſons, and made evident by competent Witneſſes; <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galeas</hi> and his Complices became ſo hard ſet, that they had nothing to ſay in their defence; wherefore they were with one Voice found Guilty. <hi>Crinon</hi> continu'd a Priſoner; but <hi>Leontius</hi> became Caution for <hi>Megaleas,</hi> bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf for the payment of the Fine the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61906:352"/>King had laid on him. This was the ſucceſs of the treaſonable Conſpiracy of <hi>Apelles</hi> and his Adherents, which had quite another iſſue than they look'd for, having promis'd to themſelves that they ſhould oblige <hi>Aratus</hi> to retire from the King out of fear; and that after they had remov'd the reſt of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who had any Truſt about him, they ſhould then Reign alone, and Rule all as they liſt; but their Project fail'd them.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time <hi>Lycurgus</hi> return'd from <hi>Meſſina</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> having done nothing worth recording: Afterwards, on a ſecond Expedition, he ſeiz'd on <hi>Tegaea;</hi> where the Inhabitants retiring into the Citadel, he reſolv'd to beſiege it. But after many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Attempts, deſpairing of Succeſs, he was oblig'd to march back to <hi>Sparta.</hi> In the mean while the <hi>Eleans</hi> made perpetual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads on the Lands of <hi>Dymas,</hi> where the Horſe of that Place, which march'd out to ſuccour the Country, were drawn into an Ambuſh, and defeated with little difficulty. Some <hi>Gauls</hi> were kill'd on the place, and certain of the Inhabitants made Priſoners; among whom were <hi>Polymedes</hi> of <hi>Aegium,</hi> and <hi>Ageſipolis</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> of <hi>Dymas.</hi>

                        <hi>Dorimachus</hi> alſo took the Field with the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Troops, in confidence, as hath been noted, that he ſhould be able to ravage <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi> and thereby oblige the King to riſe from before <hi>Palaea:</hi> But <hi>Chryſogonus</hi> and <hi>Patroeus</hi>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:61906:353"/>prevented them, being there ready to receive them with an Army; which oblig'd <hi>Dorima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> to keep the Mountains, and not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture into the Plain Country. Who, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, being inform'd that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had invaded <hi>Aetolia,</hi> march'd out of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and haſten'd to the relief of his Country; but before he arriv'd the King was retir'd. Thus <hi>Dorimachus</hi> coming always too late, made many vain Expeditions.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time King <hi>Philip</hi> having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd his Troops at <hi>Leucas,</hi> and plunder'd the Coaſt of <hi>Hyanthes</hi> in his way, arriv'd with his Fleet at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where landing his Army, and ordering the Veſſels to be drawn over to the Port of <hi>Lechoeum;</hi> he diſpatch'd his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to all the Confederate Towns of <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> appointing them a Day when they were to Rendezvous their Troops at <hi>Tegaea.</hi> And making but ſhort ſtay at <hi>Corinth,</hi> he march'd his Army by the way of <hi>Argos,</hi> and came the next Day to <hi>Tegaea;</hi> where joining ſuch of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Horſe as were there ready, he proceeded, marching over the Mountains with deſign to fall by ſurprize on the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> And after four Days march through a Deſart Country, he gain'd the tops of thoſe Eminences that lie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-againſt, and give a proſpect of the City of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and leaving <hi>Menelaium</hi> on his right, came cloſe by <hi>Amycla.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> beholding his march from the Town were greatly alarm'd, and to ſeek what to do. For the news of the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of <hi>Therme,</hi> and the many gallant Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perform'd by King <hi>Philip</hi> in his <hi>Aetolian</hi> Expedition, gave them both preſent. Terror, and future Caution. There was indeed a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour among them, as if <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſhould be ſent to the Succour of the <hi>Aetolians:</hi> But no Body could ſuſpect that King <hi>Philip</hi> would be able to compaſs ſuch a march in ſo ſhort a ſpace, while they conſider'd him too of an Age, more to be contemn'd than fear'd. Wherefore ſeeing now Matters to ſucceed ſo contrary to their Expectations, it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they became ſurpriz'd. But in a word, his Deliberations and their Effects ſo far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd the expectation of his Age, that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies every where were held in fear and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion. For marching out of the heart of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> he croſs'd the Gulf of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> and gain'd the Port of <hi>Leucas</hi> in the ſpace of one Night; where remaining but two Days only, he parted early the third, and plundering in the way all the Coaſt of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> he arriv'd ſafely at <hi>Lechoeum.</hi> From thence continuing his march, he came in ſeven Days near <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaium,</hi> gaining the Hills that give a view of the City of <hi>Sparta.</hi> So that whoſoever ſhall compute the expedition of his Motions, would not be able without difficulty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they ſaw; which was the ſubject
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61906:354"/>of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> aſtoniſhment, who knew neither what to do or reſolve.</p>
                     <p>The King's firſt Encampment was near <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mycla,</hi> a Town diſtant from <hi>Sparta</hi> about four Miles, ſurpaſſing all others in excellent Fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The next Day plundering all the <hi>Low-Country</hi> as he march'd, he came to a Place call'd <hi>Pyrrhus-Caſtle;</hi> and after doing all the ſpoil he could for two Days together in that Neighbourhood, he came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd near <hi>Carnium.</hi> From thence he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, doubting leſt their delay ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted an effect of their former backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they came to a determination to march, and to take their way by <hi>Laconia,</hi> through the Territory of the <hi>Argians,</hi> and to joyn the King's Forces with what ſpeed they might.

After this Defeat the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> return'd home by the way of <hi>Argos;</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> exalted with his Succeſs march'd back to <hi>Sparta,</hi> where he fell to making of new Levies, and to deliberate with his Friends how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo as to oblige <hi>Philip</hi> to come to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel before he left <hi>Laconia.</hi> But the King ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs march'd from <hi>Elia</hi> plundering and ravaging the Country all along in his way, and four Days aſter return'd to <hi>Amycla</hi> with his Army in view of the Enemy.</p>

Furthermore, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemonians</hi> having ſtop'd the courſe of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61906:356"/>River, had brought all that ſpace of Ground, we mention'd, under Water; ſo that it became impoſſible for their Foot, much leſs their Horſe, to march. Wherefore the King's Army had no other way to go, but in defilée along the foot of the Mountains; by which means, neither Party could ſuſtain or relieve the other; and the whole Army would run a mighty hazard, marching ſo expos'd to the continual ſhot of the Enemy. <hi>Philip</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well weighing the Peril, reſolv'd that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be better firſt done, than to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and endeavour to beat him from his Poſt. Wherefore taking with him his Mercenaries and Buckler-men, which were ſuſtain'd by the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> he paſs'd the River, and march'd directly towards the Hills. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi> who could not but underſtand the King's purpoſe, put himſelf in a poſture to receive him; and at the ſame time gave Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to thoſe within the Town; who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſally'd out, and drew up as they had been order'd, placing the Horſe on their right. When <hi>Philip</hi> was advanc'd ſomewhat near to <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> he order'd the Mercenaries to march to the Attack; and ſo began the Battel. For a while the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the advantage both in their Arms and the Ground, had alſo the better in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: But as ſoon as the Buckler-men advanc'd to ſuſtain the others, and that <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf with the <hi>Illyrians</hi> fell on their Flank, the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61906:357"/>Mercenaries on the coming up of this Relief took new Courage, and engag'd with ſo much Bravery, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was worſted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to flight, leaving about an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his Men dead on the place, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In the mean time, thoſe who were drawn up neareſt the Town attack'd the Horſe, who were poſted to cover the march of the reſt. In which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the Diſpute was very obſtinate, where the Buckler-men perform'd excellent Service. But in concluſion, the King had the better here likewiſe; and purſuing the Enemies Horſe to the Gates of the City, paſs'd the River without difficulty, and joyn'd the Phalanx. But Night now approaching, he found it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful

                     <p>Here <hi>Philip,</hi> having paſs'd the Night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Alarm, in the Morning caus'd his Baggage firſt to march; and leading the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into the Plains, he there drew up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, in view of the City of <hi>Sparta,</hi> where he remain'd a while, to ſee if the Enemy were diſpos'd to further Action: Then making a ſhort turn, took his way toward <hi>Tegaea;</hi> and

                     <p>About this time <hi>Leontius, Megaleas,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> being not yet totally out of hopes of giving ſome apprehenſion to King <hi>Philip,</hi> endeavour'd (ſo to cover their old Crimes) to foment a murmuring among the Buckler-men and the King's Guards (and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſtill'd the like ſeditious Opinions) that they who were firſt in all Hazards, and ſecur'd the reſt of the Army from Danger, were not treated according to their Merit; and were

After this manner they had ſo inflam'd them, that aſſembling in Parties, they attempted and rifled the Quarters of the King's chief Friends and Favourites; inſomuch that their inſolence grew to that height, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not at length the King's own Lodgings, breaking the Roof thereof.</p>
                     <p>This Mutiny ſpread ſo great Terror and Diſturbance about the City, that the King having notice thereof, came with all poſſible expedition from <hi>Lechoeum;</hi> and immediately aſſembling the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> partly by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, partly by Menaces, appeas'd the Tumult.

                     <p>After the King had ratify'd the Treaty of Truce, he ſent his Diſpatches to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, requiring them to ſend their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Deputies to <hi>Patroe,</hi> there to treat about the Peace with the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> then ſetting ſail from <hi>Lechoeum,</hi> he came the next Day to <hi>Patroe.</hi> About the ſame time Letters were ſent him out of <hi>Phocia,</hi> that had been writ by <hi>Megaleas</hi> to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them vigorouſly to proſecute the War, for that King <hi>Philip,</hi> through want of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Stores of War, was at the point of Deſpair. Furthermore, the ſaid Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd very reproachful and injurious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the King, which plainly evidenc'd the Man's Hatred to him. Upon reading theſe Letters, the King became firmly aſſur'd, that <hi>Apelles</hi> was at the bottom, and Author of all theſe Evils; wherefore he order'd him to be taken into Cuſtody, and forthwith brought to <hi>Corinth,</hi> together with his Son, and a Youth his Favourite. He alſo diſpatch'd <hi>Alexander</hi>

This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. <hi>Alexander</hi> executed with diligence. But <hi>Megaleas</hi> prevented him by killing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not being willing to adventure a Tryal. At the ſame time <hi>Apelles</hi> was put to death, together with his Son and Favourite.

                     <p>As to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> they were ſincerely diſpos'd to Peace, being grown weary of the War, all their Projects having ſucceeded quite otherwiſe than they had propos'd; for they expected to have to do with a Prince raw and unfit to govern, King <hi>Philip</hi> being not arriv'd at an Age, as they thought, of Conduct and Experience, while in the mean time they ſound him a ripe and enterprizing Leader, able and qualify'd both for Counſel and Execution; and the weak and unwiſe Part ſeem'd to be turn'd on themſelves, as well with reſpect to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of their particular Affairs, as the Conduct of the War in general. But when they came to hear of the Mutiny of the Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-men, and the Death of <hi>Leontius</hi> and <hi>Apelles,</hi> hoping theſe Troubles would beget Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at Court, they therefore reſpited their meeting at <hi>Rhium,</hi> which they did from time

Wherefore, after he had exhorted and animated the Confederates to the proſecution of the War, he weigh'd Anchor again, and ſail'd back to <hi>Corinth.</hi> Then ſending his <hi>Macedonians</hi> to their Winter. Quarters in their own Country, they took their march home through <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> while he himſelf, after his departure from <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> coaſting it along the <hi>Attic</hi> Shoar, came by the <hi>Euripus</hi> to <hi>Demetrias,</hi> where <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the only remaining Conſpirator in the Treaſon of <hi>Apelles,</hi> was ſentenc'd by the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and accordingly put to death.</p>
                     <p>It was about this time that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> having gain'd his Paſſage into <hi>Italy,</hi> was encamp'd on the Banks of the <hi>Po,</hi> in view of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> having reduc'd to his Dominion a great part of <hi>Syria,</hi> had put his Army into Garriſons; and that <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill-dealing from the <hi>Ephori,</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn and retir'd into <hi>Aetolia:</hi> For he had been wrongfully accus'd to them, as if he had meditated ſome Innovation in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61906:362"/>
                     <p>The King being now return'd home about the beginning of Winter, the <hi>Achaian</hi> Troops holding <hi>Eperatas</hi> the Praetor in contempt, and the mercenary Strangers in like manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him as a Man of no worth, inſomuch that they came to deſpiſe his Authority, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to pay him Obedience; by which means it came to paſs, that they wanted Troops to guard and defend their Frontiers.</p>
                     <p>This became a motive to <hi>Pyrrhias,</hi> (whom the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had ſent to command the <hi>Elean</hi> Forces) to compoſe an Army conſiſting of fourteen hundred <hi>Aetolians,</hi> about a thouſand Mercenaries and Militia of the Town, and two hundred Horſe, making in all about three thouſand Men; and with theſe he did not only waſte the Territory of <hi>Dymas</hi> and <hi>Pharoe,</hi> but proceeded to <hi>Patroe;</hi> and taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Mountain <hi>Panachaicus</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Town, he plunder'd and put to Fire and Sword all the Country that lies in the way to <hi>Rhium</hi> and <hi>Aegium;</hi> inſomuch that thoſe Towns of <hi>Achaia</hi> which labour'd under theſe Evils, and ſaw no hopes of redreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came conſtrain'd to ſubmit to lie under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution: For the Soldiers being in Arrear of their Pay, refus'd to receive Orders, when at any time they were commanded to march on any Expedition for the relief of the Country. Whereupon the Affairs of the <hi>Achaians</hi> grew from bad to worſe, their mercenary Troops daily deſerting the Service: All which Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61906:363"/>were, in a word, to be aſcrib'd to the Inſufficiency of <hi>Eperatus</hi> the Praetor. Matters ſtood in this poſture then in <hi>Achaia</hi> when <hi>Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi>'s Authority expir'd, who was ſucceeded, early in the Summer, by <hi>Aratus</hi> the Elder.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have ſpoken of the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> only; now purſuing the Order of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, we are arriv'd, as it were, at a fair and eaſie paſſage to thoſe of <hi>Aſia;</hi> let us proceed then to recount the Hoſtilities tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in thoſe parts of the World, contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the others we have already related.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall begin, as we promis'd, with the Hiſtory of the War, that was wag'd between <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> for the <hi>Lower Syria.</hi> For albeit Hoſtilities were yet on Foot between theſe two Princes, at the time we brake off our Relation of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Affairs; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we had good reaſon to purſue that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, for the better uniting the Parts of our Hiſtory. And to prevent the danger of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in the Reader, touching the Date of Tranſactions, we conceive we have therein done enough, when in ſpeaking of what was there acted during that <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and what at the ſame time in <hi>Greece,</hi> we have punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remark'd the beginning and end of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Tranſactions. Furthermore, for the better perſpicuity of our Hiſtory, and that we may render it more intelligible, we have judg'd it moſt behoveful not to mingle the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of that <hi>Olympiad,</hi> but to refer it to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61906:363"/>ſubſequent Times, when wo ſhall aſſign to each Year its peculiar Actions and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in order as they happen'd. For having undertaken to write not any particular or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Hiſtory, but to recount all that was done every where at the ſame time; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as we have engag'd in a Work ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to all who have gone before us; we ought therefore to make it our chief Buſineſs ſo to diſpoſe of the ſeveral Members, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the Parts in ſuch order, that the whole may appear uniform and entire: and yet that no one part thereof may be liable to obſcurity. Whereof after we ſhall have here firſt hinted ſome diſtant matters touching the Reigns of <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> we ſhall then proceed to give our Story ſuch a beginning, as ſhall be evident and known to all, and of a piece with the Occurrences which preceded.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients have ſomewhere ſaid, That a good beginning is half the Work; whereby they would inſtruct us, that in all our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, our principal Care ſhould be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin well whatſoever we go about: And 'tis poſſible ſome may object, That they have herein gone too far, while in my Judgment they have ſaid leſs than the matter will bear. For I think it may with ſafety be maintain'd, That not the half only of any Enterprize is effected when 'tis well begun, but the whole well-nigh brought to paſs: For 'tis impoſſible to enter ſucceſsfully on any Deſign whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61906:364"/>without having firſt form'd and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the whole Project, and meditated with deliberation both on the beginning, progreſs, and end. For who can be able to give a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, or Recapitulation, of what he hath written at the end of his Diſcourſe, if there be not connexion or coherence in what he hath deliver'd, whereby it may be diſcern'd, from whence, why, and how matters have been conducted to that iſſue? He therefore who would write a General Hiſtory, or would but ſtudy it as he ought, ſhould above all things labour to begin well, and then he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the better half of his Work done. And this ſhall be our utmoſt Endeavour.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, 'tis ſeen that moſt Hiſtorians ſay with me, That they write a General Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and that their Work is the greateſt that hath ever been undertaken. But of all theſe Authors, I know none, <hi>Ephorus</hi> excepted, who was the firſt and only Writer that hath propos'd indeed to compoſe a General Hiſtory. But I will not arraign any one here in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and only remark, that there have been Authors in theſe our days, who undertaking to write Hiſtory, have in three or four Pages, comprehended the Wars of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and with aſſurance are bold to boaſt they have therein written the whole Story of the Univerſe. True it is, that that Age was celebrated for many great Actions both in <hi>Spain, Africk, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61906:364"/>the War of <hi>Hannibal</hi> exceeded all others, both for Dignity and Duration, except the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War, when the Dominion of <hi>Sicily</hi> was conteſted; which, in ſhort, was ſuch as held the whole World in ſuſpence, all Nations under great Fear and Uncertainty attending the Event. But who is ſo ſtupid or incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that is not in ſome meaſure inſtructed in theſe Adventures? And yet there are Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who tho' they have touch'd never ſo ſuperficially thoſe matters, would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſuade us they have left nothing unſaid of the Affairs of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and theſe I think may be fitly compar'd to thoſe Painters, who according to the cuſtom of ſome States, draw on the Walls of their Publick Buildings, the Hiſtory of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in divers Ages and Places, and would be thought to have therein repreſented every thing juſt as it was done.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be demanded then, how Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians come to be guilty of this Vanity? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That it is eaſie to promiſe any thing, and as eaſie to undertake and engage in the moſt difficult Enterprizes by Words and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but few there are who rightly weigh the Difficulty of the execution. The one is common and familiar, the other rare and next to impoſſible; and whoſoever he may be that hath compaſs'd it, it muſt have been at the coſt of mighty Pains, and the product of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years of Life. Thus much I have thought
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61906:365"/>fit to ſay, in reproof of ſuch as over boaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifie their Works, and vain-gloriouſly ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> their own Merit. But now let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to our Buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Philopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> took on him the Government of that Kingdom on the death of his Father, and the murder of <hi>Megas</hi> his Brother and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; by which means, and ſome other Acts of Caution, he reckon'd himſelf ſecure againſt any Attempts from thoſe of his own Houſe, and concluded Fortune Herſelf had cover'd him from all Dangers abroad. Furthermore, <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> being now dead, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> ſucceeding them, who were yet but young, and hardly out of their Childhood: <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> I ſay, for theſe Reaſons beholding himſelf ſhelter'd on all ſides from Danger, govern'd his Kingdom as if his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Eaſe had been now his only Buſineſs, and reſign'd up to a voluptuous Life, forgot the Duties of his Dignity, and grew to neglect every body and every thing; all acceſs to him became difficult, as well to thoſe of his own Court, as others who had charge of Publick Affairs, both within and without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; albeit the Kings his Predeceſſors had been no leſs ſolicitous for the one than the other, and as jealous of their Authority abroad as at home. For the Lieutenants of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in <hi>Caelo-Syria</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi> were wont to wage War with the neighbouring Princes of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61906:365"/>
                        <hi>Syria</hi> by Land and Sea; and thoſe, who had the Government of their principal Towns on the Sea-coaſt from <hi>Pamphylia</hi> to the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont,</hi> and who had the Command of the Country bordering on <hi>Lyſimachia,</hi> kept a watchful Eye on the Actions of the Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of the Iſlands; while thoſe that rul'd in <hi>Aenus, Maronea,</hi> and the Towns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, were as careful to obſerve the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and the Occurrences of <hi>Thrace.</hi> Inſomuch that the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſo wide a Dominion, were cover'd, as one may ſay, with a Buckler againſt all thoſe Princes, and never took thought for <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf, while the Avenues were ſo carefully kept. But foraſmuch as the King we are ſpeaking of now left all things at random, while himſelf, diſſolv'd in Love and Wine, took care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; it was not ſtrange that he ſhould ſoon find Enemies, who would conſpire againſt both his Life and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe was <hi>Cleomenes</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who attempted nothing during the Life of <hi>Ptolomy Euergetes,</hi> with whom he was in great Friendſhip, and by whoſe Favour and Aſſiſtance, he had hopes of recovering his Kingdom. But after his Death, and his own Affairs inviting him to try his Fortune, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> being alſo now dead, and the <hi>Achaians</hi> diverted by War; and what <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had ever ardently labour'd to effect being come to paſs, namely, that the <hi>Aetolians</hi> confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61906:366"/>with the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> (who equally hated the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi>) ſhould jointly enter into a War againſt theſe two States. Theſe things, I ſay, falling out, were a motive to preſs by all means poſſible his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And firſt he mov'd the King therein, demanding Succours both of Men and Stores of War. Afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him to lend no very willing Ear to his ſuit, he beſought him at leaſt for permiſſion for himſelf and Followers to depart; for that be could not hope for a more favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, than that which now offer'd, for the recovery of his Kingdom. But <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> amus'd neither with future nor preſent things, giving himſelf up to his Pleaſures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches, came to no Reſolution touching the Requeſt of <hi>Cleomenes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, <hi>Soſibius,</hi> who at that time was firſt Miniſter of State, and govern'd the Affairs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> coming to conſult with his Friends thereupon, it was concluded among them, that it was not ſafe not only to ſupply <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> with what he demanded, but even to let him depart the Kingdom. For after the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> they came to neglect their Frontier Provinces, taking for granted, that the expence of thoſe Affairs was now needleſs They furthermore conſider'd, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> having now no Rival in <hi>Greece</hi> that could withſtand him, became jealous leſt coming to recover the Dominion of that Country, he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61906:366"/>might not become a formidable Enemy to them; knowing, as he ſo well did, the Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their King, and the general State of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Affairs, and that their Provinces were remote and diſjointed, which he might greatly improve to their damage: For at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> they had a numerous Fleet, and at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> a great Body of Troops. Wherefore, I ſay, they reſolv'd that it would not be Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to permit not only that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſhould go with an Army, but not ſafe to permit him to quit the Country at all, conſidering the Greatneſs of his Character, and how he had been diſoblig'd, which he would conſequently ſtudy to revenge. It remain'd then that they muſt determine to detain him by force; and yet they wanted Reſolution to conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, looking on it as a dangerous Attempt to impriſon a Lion among a Flock of Sheep; and <hi>Soſibius</hi> himſelf became of that mind, for the Reaſons we ſhall now deliver.</p>
                     <p>At what time they were deliberating about putting <hi>Magas</hi> and <hi>Berenice</hi> to death, fearing; leſt their Deſign might miſcarry through the great Power and Reſolution of <hi>Berenice.</hi> The Conſpirators therefore were oblig'd to flatter and treat, with better uſage than ordinary, ſome Perſons about the Court; and to give them Aſſurances of great Advantages, in caſe their Deſign ſucceeded. Wherefore <hi>Soſibius</hi> well knowing of what importance it was to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to acquire the Good-will of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61906:367"/>King, whoſe Aſſiſtance he needed, and that he was an able and well experienc'd Perſon, came to reveal the Conſpiracy to him, adding many fair Promiſes, and Aſſurances of his good Offices in his Service; whereupon <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> taking hotice of the Diſturbance he was under, and that they very much appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Danger from their Mercenaries, told him he might be ought of pain in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for that thoſe People ſhould give them no moleſtation; but, on the contrary, if need were, ſhould lend them their aſſiſtance. This was a ſurprizing Saying to <hi>Soſibius,</hi> while <hi>Cleomenes</hi> proceeded; adding, that there were few leſs than three thouſand <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> in the Army of Mercenaries, and at leaſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Candiots,</hi> who, upon his leaſt beck, would be at his Command; and from the Troops of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Caria,</hi> there was no danger to be fear'd. In ſhort, this Diſcourſe at that time greatly pleas'd <hi>Soſibius,</hi> and animated him to the murder of <hi>Berenice.</hi> But afterwards as often as he ruminated on the Folly and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the King, and the hardy and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Qualities of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and the Affection the mercenary Soldiers bore him, he could not contain his Fear. Wherefore he prevail'd with the King and thoſe about him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> might be taken into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody: And the better to compaſs his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he made uſe of an occaſion we ſhall now relate. There chanc'd to be at that time in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61906:367"/>theſe Parts, a certain <hi>Meſſenian</hi> call'd <hi>Nicago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> who had been an old Friend of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Archidamus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta;</hi> and albeit with <hi>Archidamus</hi> himſelf he had not had that intimacy, nevertheleſs upon his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the City out of fear of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to <hi>Meſſena, Nicagoras</hi> did not only hoſpitably receive him into his Houſe, and ſupply him with all things neceſſary, but grew at length to cultivate a Friendſhip with him, equal to that which had been heretofore between him and his Father. Wherefore when afterwards it came to paſs, that <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> had given <hi>Archidamus</hi> ſome hopes of his return, and that there appear'd ſome likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of an Accord, <hi>Nicagoras</hi> interpos'd his good Offices, and acted in the Treaty between them.</p>
                     <p>After all things ſeem'd to be adjuſted, and that <hi>Archidamus</hi> on the Faith of <hi>Nicagoras</hi>'s Treaty was returning, and on his way to <hi>Sparta,</hi> he was intercepted by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and ſlain, but without any Violence offer'd either to <hi>Nicagoras,</hi> who was in his company, or any body elſe of his Train. Wherefore <hi>Nicago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> tho' he made publick profeſſion of his Obligation to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> for ſparing his Life, nevertheleſs he harbour'd in his Mind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments ſuitable to that Outrage. This <hi>Nicagoras</hi> then coming to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of certain Horſes he had brought over, as he was landing meets with <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61906:368"/>with <hi>Panteus</hi> and <hi>Hippitas</hi> were walking on the Strand. As ſoon as <hi>Cleomenes</hi> knew him, he came and ſaluted him in friendly manner, demanding what buſineſs had brought him thither? And when he told him, he had brought over ſome Horſes to ſell; <hi>Cleomenes</hi> reply'd, That he would have made a better Voyage, if he had brought a Cargo of Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons, and Beautiful Boys, for that the preſent King like'd that ſort of Merchandiſe much better. At which ſaying <hi>Nicagoras</hi> ſmiling, reply'd little; but a while after coming to have ſome Diſcourſe with <hi>Soſibius</hi> about the diſpoſal of his Horſes, he told him what <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> had ſaid, not without deſign of doing him an ill Office at Court; and perceiving <hi>Soſibius</hi> pleas'd with the Relation, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reveal to him the Subject of his Hatred, and the Averſion he bore to <hi>Cleomenes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Soſibius,</hi> coming thus to diſcover that <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> was an Enemy to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> prevail'd with him by Gifts and Promiſes to write a Letter to him, containing Accuſations againſt <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> which Letter ſhould be leſt with one of his Servants on his departure, to be by him brought ſome Days after, as if <hi>Nicagoras</hi> had diſpatch'd him for that purpoſe. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a Letter was written, and the Matter conducted as had been agreed, and as ſoon as <hi>Nicagoras</hi> was gone, the Meſſenger brought the Letter to <hi>Soſibius,</hi> which, together with the Bearer, he immediately carried to the King. The
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61906:368"/>Contents were, that in caſe <hi>Cleomenes</hi> were not ſpeedily diſpatch'd with a Body of Troops, and all things neceſſary for his Enterprize, he would be the occaſion of great Troubles in the Kingdom. This then was the Engine whereby <hi>Soſibius</hi> wrought with the King and his Creatures to determine on putting <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> under Confinement, and ſecuring him with a good Guard. Whereupon he was ſecur'd, having a large Houſe appointed him for his Priſon, which differ'd from others in nothing, but that it was more ſpacious. And now <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> perceiving there was no hope left him, reſolv'd however to attempt his Inlargement by all the ways he could imagine, whereby to compaſs it; not that he ſaw how it could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be effected, being deſtitute of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means to put his purpoſe in Execution, at leaſt he reſolv'd to die like himſelf, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yield to ſtain that Vertue which had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him ſo conſiderable in the World. And I am ready to believe he had his Mind prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, and ſet before his Eyes what all great Men do in the like Exigencies.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61906:369"/>on that pretext he caus'd Proviſion to be made for a great Entertainment to thoſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſending to his Guards plenty of Meat and Wine, Garlands of Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſomuch that the Soldiers drinking too plentifully, he took that occaſion about mid-day to eſcape out of Priſon, with all his Domeſticks in his Company; who with their drawn Swords meeting in the Market-place with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Town, they threw him out of his Chariot, and kill'd him on the place amidſt his Guards, who ſtood aſtoniſh'd at the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Action; in the mean time, crying <hi>Liberty, Liberty,</hi> as they paſs'd along. But when they ſaw none appoach to join them, all People ſtanding amaz'd at the Greatneſs of the Enterprize, they then betook them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtle, with deſign to ſet all the Priſoners at liberty, and to make uſe of their aſſiſtance: but thoſe who Commanded in that Fortreſs ſuſpecting their purpoſe, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Not long after, <hi>Theodotus</hi> an <hi>Aetolian,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> revolted; partly out of Contempt of the King, who led ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous a life, and partly out of an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ill Offices done him by the great ones at Court ſome time before; notwithſtanding the good Service he had done the King in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions, and principally in the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> for the <hi>Lower Syria:</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he was ſo far from being conſider'd according to his Merit, that being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to Court, he there ran great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his Life. Wherefore on theſe Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Theodotus</hi> reſolv'd to apply himſelf to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and to put the Towns of that Country into his Hands; which Overture was gladly receiv'd by that Prince, and the Deſign ſoon after put in Execution. But that we may Treat of the Family of this Prince in the ſame Method we have done the laſt, we ſhall have occaſion to go a little back; and taking our beginning from the time of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>'s coming to the Crown, we ſhall deſcend to the Subject of the War, whereof we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Treat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Younger then, was the Son of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who was ſirnam'd <hi>Callinicus;</hi> who after the Death of his Father, and the Acceſſion of his Elder Brother to the Crown, went into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Aſia,</hi> where he held his Abode for ſome time. But on the Death of <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Brother, who was Treacherouſly
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61906:370"/>ſlain in his Expedition over Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> as we have elſewhere Noted; <hi>Antiochus</hi> Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him who made <hi>Achoeus</hi> Governour of all that part of <hi>Aſia</hi> on this ſide Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> and gave to <hi>Molon</hi> and his Brother, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Upper Provinces; namely, to <hi>Molon</hi> the <hi>Satrapie</hi> (ſo call'd) of <hi>Media,</hi> and to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But theſe two Brothers contemning the Youth of the King, and being in hopes <hi>Achoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> would join with them in the like Deſign; and apprehending above all things, the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perverſe Mind and Calumnies of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias,</hi> who at that time Rul'd Affairs at Court; wherefore they came to a Reſolution of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off their Obedience, and of endeavouring to withdraw the other <hi>Satrapa</hi>'s from their Duty to the King. <hi>Hermias</hi> was a <hi>Carian</hi> by Birth, and receiv'd his Authority, and the Adminiſtration of the Government, at the Hands of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> who at his Departure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> had committed the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom, during his Abſence, to his Care; who beholding himſelf thus Exalted, grew to Envy and Suſpect all who had any Truſt or Share in the King's Eſteem. In a Word, being naturally a Tyrant, he would ordinarily puniſh the ſlighteſt Faults with Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, making them greater by his Exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and often appear'd a Cruel and Inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Judge towards others who had no Faults but of his finding. But above all things, he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61906:370"/>was bent on the Ruine of <hi>Epigenes,</hi> who had the Charge of leading back the Troops, that were Aſſembled out of Affection to <hi>Seleucus.</hi> For he well knew him to be a Man both Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and Able for Execution, and who had great Authority in the Army. This he could not brook; wherefore he watch'd him with a Malicious Eye, and ſtudy'd by all ways poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to render him Obnoxious. In ſhort, it chanc'd, that while they were deliberating in Council about the Rebellion of <hi>Molon,</hi> and on the King's Command, that every one ſhould deliver his Judgment freely, touching the Means of Suppreſſing the Rebels; <hi>Epigenes</hi> ſpeaking firſt, gave it as his Opinion, That it was an Affair that would not endure delay, and that the Remedies ought ſpeedily to be applied to the Diſeaſe: That he Conceiv'd the King's Preſence was abſolutely neceſſary, whoſe Authority on the place would weigh much: That in ſuch caſe neither <hi>Molon</hi> nor his Partizans would have the aſſurance to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Errour, beholding the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Head of his Army: Or ſhould they chance to continue obſtinate, the very Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would Mutiny, and deliver them up to the King.</p>
                     <p>Hardly had <hi>Epigenes</hi> finiſh'd his Diſcourſe, when <hi>Hermias</hi> in paſſionate manner reply'd, That this was not the firſt Traiterous Counſel he had given: That he had long harbour'd Evil Purpoſes towards the King: That it now
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61906:371"/>pleas'd him however to behold him openly, declaring his Wickedneſs in the pernicious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had offer'd, wherein he plainly ſhew'd his Deſign of giving up the King into the Hands of the Rebels. He added nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at that time on that Subject, ſeeming content to have thus ſown the Seeds of Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and Calumny againſt him, expreſſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Indignation than Hatred. In a Word, his Ignorance in Military Affairs (it may be) gave him greater Apprehenſion of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than needed: Wherefore his Advice was, That no Army ſhould be ſent againſt <hi>Molon,</hi> but that they ſhould March againſt <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> who being a Vicious and Careleſs Prince, he concluded that War would be Manag'd with leſs danger. Howbeit, after he had thus aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the Aſſembly, he yielded that <hi>Molon</hi> ſhould be Proſecuted by War, and that the Chief Command in that Expedition ſhould be given to <hi>Xeno</hi> and <hi>Theodotus,</hi> Counſelling the King to purſue the Recovery of the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> to the end that Young Prince being Engag'd and Surrounded with Troubles from all Quarters, and keeping him in perpetual Action, he might, as he conceiv'd, render himſelf the more neceſſary, and cover with more ſafety, the Crimes of which he was Conſcious, and better ſecure his Credit with his Maſter. Purſuant to which Deſign, he Forges Letters from <hi>Achoeus,</hi> and brought them to the King; which Letters contain'd
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61906:371"/>King <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Solicitations to him, to take on him the Royalty, promiſing him his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance both of Money, Ships, and all things he ſhould ſtand in need of, provided he would Aſſume the Crown, and the other Marks of Regality, whereof he was in effect already Poſſeſs'd, tho' he ſhun'd the Title, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the Tender of a Diadem which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune her ſelf made him. This Letter found ſo much Credit with the King, that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon determin'd forthwith earneſtly to purſue the War in <hi>Caelo-Syria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While theſe Matters were under agitation, <hi>Antiochus</hi> being at <hi>Seleucia, Diognetus</hi> his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral at Sea arriv'd, bringing with him <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who was Eſpous'd to <hi>Antiochus.</hi> This <hi>Mithridates</hi> boaſted of his being Deſcended from one of the Seven <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſlew the <hi>Magi,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſſeſſion of that Dominion, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> had heretofore given to his Anceſtors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as far as the Coaſt of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. <hi>Antiochus</hi> went in great Pomp to receive this Princeſs, whom he preſently Marry'd, the Nuptials being Solemniz'd with all poſſible Magnificence. As ſoon as the Ceremony was over, he carry'd her to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he caus'd her to be receiv'd as Queen; and then turn'd his Thoughts to prepare for the War. In the mean time <hi>Molon</hi> had prepar'd the People of his Government for every thing he might be diſpos'd to attempt, as well by the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61906:372"/>hopes of Reward, as through the fear where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had poſſeſs'd the Principal Officers, by angry and menacing Letters counterfeited from the King. Furthermore, his Brother was in a readineſs to join him; and he had well provided againſt all danger that might threaten from the Neighbour-Provinces, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at great Expence to Purchaſe the Good Will of thoſe, who had any Authority among them; and, in a Word, March'd with his Army to Incounter the King's Forces. While <hi>Xeno</hi> and <hi>Theodotus</hi> were ſo terrify'd at his approach, that they retir'd and ſecur'd themſelves in the Neighbouring Towns. Whereupon <hi>Molon</hi> making himſelf Maſter of the Territory of <hi>Apollonia,</hi> became ſupply'd with all ſorts of Proviſions of War in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and was already grown formidable in appearance, and in effect: For, firſt the King's breed of Horſes was intirely in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Medes;</hi> which Country moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abounds in Corn and all ſorts of Cattel. As to its Strength, all that can be ſaid, would not amount to half what the Subject will bear. <hi>Media</hi> is Situate in the heart of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and if compariſon be made between that and the other parts, it will be found to ſurpaſs all the Provinces thereof, both in extent of Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and height of the Mountains that ſurround it. They have many powerful Nations that are their Borderers: On the Eaſt are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts which lie between <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Paraſia.</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:61906:372"/>The <hi>Caſpian</hi> Paſs call'd the <hi>Gates,</hi> is in their keeping, where they touch on the Mountains <hi>Tapyroe,</hi> which are not far from <hi>Hyrcania.</hi> It extends towards the South to <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and the Territory of the <hi>Apolloniates.</hi> Nor is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>Perſia,</hi> being cover'd on that ſide by the Mountain <hi>Zagros,</hi> which hath an aſcent of above twelve Miles. And whereas this Mountain is divided and broken into many Parts and Eminencies, it comes to paſs that there are divers Vallies and deep Deſcents, which are inhabited by the <hi>Coſſoei, Corbrenoe</hi> and <hi>Carchi,</hi> and other Barbarous Nations, who are generally given to War. Towards the Weſt they approach the Country of <hi>Atropatii,</hi> who are not far from thoſe People, whoſe Dominion extends as far as the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. The Frontiers of <hi>Media</hi> towards the North, are in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Elymaei, Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racoe, Cadducoei, Matiani,</hi> and in ſhort, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look thoſe Countries on the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea, that join the <hi>Palus Moeotis.</hi> The Country is alſo parted into ſundry Diviſions, by Mountains, which run through it from Eaſt to Weſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which there are Plains abounding with Cities, and Peopled Places.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Molon</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of this Country, the moſt proper of all others wherein to eſtabliſh the Seat of his Dominion; over and above that, he was become formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as was noted, by the Power he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd; he grew likewiſe into ſuch Reputation,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61906:373"/>that the People of <hi>Aſia</hi> believ'd he was not to be reſiſted; eſpecially when they ſaw the King's Army had been forc'd to Retreat into Towns for ſafety; which they took for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was no other than yielding up the Field: This Succeſs greatly augmented the Courage and Expectations of his Army. Wherefore he reſolv'd to paſs the <hi>Tigris,</hi> and march to the Seige of <hi>Seleucia.</hi> But being prevented in that Deſign by <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> who had ſeiz'd on the Veſſels of Tranſportation, he retir'd to a Place call'd <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> where he made plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Proviſion of all Neceſſaries for the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Army. When the King came to underſtand that <hi>Molon</hi> Advanc'd, and that his own Army retir'd, he then reſolv'd to go at the Head of his Forces, and to reſpite for a while, his Expedition againſt <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> But <hi>Hermias</hi> continu'd firm to his Purpoſe, and prevail'd to divert him; ſo <hi>Xenoetas</hi> an <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> was ſent with an Army, having as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority as if the King had been there in Perſon; <hi>Hermias</hi> demonſtrating that 'twas enough for Princes to make War againſt Rebels by their Lieutenants, but that Kings ought to oppoſe themſelves only to their Equals, where Glory and Empire is the Subject in Diſpute. Thus having the young Prince intirely in his Poſſeſſion, he prevail'd to carry on his firſt Deſign, ſo they went to <hi>Apamea,</hi> where they Aſſembled the Troops. From thence the King lead his Army to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> then march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61906:373"/>through the Deſart, they came to the Valley of <hi>Marſya</hi> between the Mountains <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> and <hi>Anti-Libanus,</hi> a Place very ſtreight and inclos'd by thoſe Mountains which come almoſt to touch; and there where it is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt, it is full of low and watery Ground, where they gather Odoriferous Dew. The Caſtle of <hi>Brochi</hi> Commands on the one ſide of the Streight, on the other that of <hi>Gerra;</hi> there being only a narrow way between them. After ſome time had been ſpent in their March through this Vale, and the taking in ſome Neighbouring Towns, the King approached <hi>Gerra;</hi> but both the one and the other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs being in the Hands of <hi>Theodotus</hi> the <hi>Aetolian,</hi> who had likewiſe well Fortify'd the Defilée about the low Grounds, and Poſted Troops Commodiouſly for Defence, the King reſolv'd to force his Paſſage. But when he had well conſider'd, that by Seiges he ſhould Harraſs his Army, and be more a Sufferer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than the Enemy; and having ſome Reaſons to believe that <hi>Theodotus</hi> would ſhortly be wrought over to his Service, he forbore to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute that Enterprize; ſo that having no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Proſpect of ſucceeding here, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of the Defeat of <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> and that <hi>Molon</hi> Victorious had ſubdu'd many Provinces, he reſolv'd to relinquiſh all other Deſigns, and deliberate on thoſe Affairs which more nearly concern'd him. For <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> as we noted, being ſent with an Authority full and abſolute,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61906:374"/>could not well bear that Degree of Greatneſs, which he had never hop'd to attain, but grew inſolent towards his Friends, and acted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately againſt the Enemy. For taking his march towards <hi>Seleucia,</hi> having <hi>Diogenes</hi> Governour of <hi>Suſiana,</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi> with him, who brought his Troops from the Coaſt of the Red-Sea, under his Command; he came and encamp'd in view of the Enemy, being cover'd on that ſide by the <hi>Tigris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time many Deſerters from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s Army, ſwimming the River, came over to <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> who gave him aſſurance, that in caſe he paſs'd the River with his Army, the greateſt part of the Enemies Troops would revolt to him, many of the Leaders being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblig'd by <hi>Molon;</hi> and that the Soldiers in general were diſpos'd to return to their Duty. <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> incourag'd by theſe Reports, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to paſs over the Army, and ſhew'd a purpoſe to make a Bridge at a certain place where by the force of the Stream the Earth is caſt up in form of an Iſland, but he did not proſecute that Deſign: Whereupon <hi>Molon</hi> made a Jeſt of his Project. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> in the mean time, caus'd Boats to be built, and ſeiz'd on others where they could be ſound, to put in execution what he had purpos'd. Then picking out a Body of the beſt Troops of the Army, both Horſe and Foot, and leaving <hi>Zeuxes</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi> with the reſt to guard the Camp, he waſted over
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61906:374"/>his Men by Night, marching and encamping about Ten Miles above the Enemy, where he made choice of a commodious and well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended piece of Ground to encamp in; for the River inviron'd it almoſt quite round, and the reſt was ſecur'd by a Moor, and deep boggy Ground. <hi>Molon,</hi> upon knowledge hereof, detach'd a Body of Horſe with Command to march towards the Enemy, partly to prevent the paſſing of thoſe that remain'd behind; and partly to attack thoſe who were already got over. But on their approach to <hi>Xenoetas</hi>'s Camp there was no need of the Swords of an Enemy to defeat them; for being, it ſeems, unacquainted with the Ground and Country about it, they chanc'd to fall among the Bogs and watery places, whereby not only their Deſign miſcarried, but moſt of the Party were loſt. Wherefore <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> now perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if he drew nearer to the Enemies Camp, the greateſt part of the Army would deſert to him, took his march along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and came and Encamp'd cloſe by them. Whereupon <hi>Molon,</hi> either out of Stratagem, or ſome real doubt of the Soldiers Diſpoſition, left his Camp by Night, with all his Baggage, ſeeming to take his march towards <hi>Media. Xenoetas</hi> now believing that <hi>Molon</hi> had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Camp through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear upon his approach, or through diſtruſt of his own Troops, took poſſeſſion thereof, where he quarter'd his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, giving his Orders, that the Horſe and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61906:375"/>Baggage of <hi>Zeuxes</hi> Camp ſhould forthwith paſs over and joyn him. Then aſſembling the Soldiers, he incourag'd them, by giving them hopes of a good iſſue of the War, for that <hi>Molon</hi> had already thought it his ſafeſt courſe to ſly before them; ſo commanding them to refreſh and repoſe themſelves, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them to be in a readineſs to march by break of Day in purſuit of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>And now the Army of <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> full of Aſſurance, and being poſſeſs'd of ſo great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all things, fell to Feaſting and making Merry, Drinking to exceſs, and acting in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing the parts of careleſs diſſolute Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. While <hi>Molon,</hi> when he thought he was got far enough, made an halt; and taking ſome ſpace to refreſh his People, fac'd about, and march'd directly back by the way he came; and advancing to the Camp, found the Enemy negligently ſcatter'd here and there, plung'd in Sleep and Wine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attacking them at Day-break. <hi>Xenoetas,</hi> aſtoniſh'd at the ſurprize, and not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and draw his Troops together to make head againſt the Enemy, loſt his Life, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly fighting. The greateſt part of the Army were cut off in their Tents, the reſt caſting themſelves into the River, hop'd to gain the Camp on the other ſide, but very few eſcap'd over. Here might be ſeen the divers Scenes of Tumult and Confuſion in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for all had their ſhare of Terror, at an
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61906:375"/>Attempt ſo unlook'd for: And while they view'd their Camp on the other Bank of the River, without regard to the violence of the Stream, or the difficulty and danger of the Paſſage, ſuch was their Paſſion to eſcape the Swords of the Enemy; their fear, I ſay, had ſo blinded their Judgment, that to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the hands of thoſe that purſu'd them, they committed themſelves to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, making their Horſes, Baggage, and all attempt to paſs the River, as if they thought ſome ſpecial Providence had commanded the Flood to yield them ſuccour, and waft them ſafe to the other Shore; ſo that it was a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſight to behold at once Men, Horſes, Arms, Baggage, the Dead and Living floating and mingled together in confuſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Molon</hi> becoming Maſter of <hi>Xenoetas</hi>'s Camp, afterwards paſs'd the River without impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, none withſtanding him; for <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> who might have hinder'd him, was fled; wherefore he took poſſeſſion likewiſe of the other Camp. Then upon this Succeſs he march'd ſpeedily to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> which ſoon fell into his hands; for that <hi>Zeuxes</hi> and <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who was Governour of the Place, had deſerted it. Then reducing the upper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to his Obedience, where he found none to oppoſe him, he march'd on, and ſubdu'd the whole Country of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and all the Territory extending as far as the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> From thence he march'd to <hi>Suſa,</hi> which was
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61906:376"/>taken by Aſſault, as other Places had been; but he in vain attempted the Fortreſs of that Place, for that <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Governour had made timely proviſion for his Defence: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he forbore to uſe force, but leaving Troops to block it up, took his march back to <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> where he refreſh'd and recruited his Army; and then after he had well encourag'd them, he proceeded on further Enterprizes. Thus <hi>Molon</hi> reduc'd all the Country to the City <hi>Europus,</hi> and all <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> as far as <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Antiochus</hi> came to be well inform'd of theſe Occurrences, he quitted the barren Country of the <hi>Lower-Syria,</hi> (as we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and turn'd his Thoughts wholly on this War. Wherefore aſſembling his Council once again to deliberate about it, and requiring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to deliver his Opinion plainly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War of <hi>Molon; Epigenes</hi> again firſt gave his Judgment, ſaying, That it had been well for the King's Service, if they had follow'd his firſt Advice without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay or loſs of time; for the Enemy had made ſo great a progreſs, that he was confirm'd in his former Opinion; namely, That it was moſt neceſſary the King ſhould march with the Army, and manage the War in Perſon. But <hi>Hermias</hi> thereupon renew'd his Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt <hi>Epigenes,</hi> charging and blaming him as heretofore; and came to exaggerate his own Praiſes to that degree, that every body
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61906:376"/>deſpis'd him; and conteſting with the King himſelf, labour'd all he could to make him perſevere in his <hi>Syrian</hi> Expedition; inſomuch, that great Offence was taken by <hi>Antiochus</hi> himſelf, who notwithſtanding interpos'd his Authority in vain to reconcile them, <hi>Hermias</hi> being by no means to be wrought from his Averſion to <hi>Epigenes.</hi> Howbeit, his Advice at length prevail'd, as being the moſt ſafe and profitable; which <hi>Hermias</hi> not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now longer to hinder, ſeem'd on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to accord entirely to what he cou'd not prevent; and becoming (as one may ſay) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man, reſolv'd, that laying aſide all other Affairs, the War with <hi>Molon</hi> ought to be vigorouſly proſecuted: Wherefore he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf with great diligence, and turn'd all his Thoughts to make preparation for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it on.</p>
                     <p>And now when the King's Troops were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd at <hi>Apamea,</hi> there grew a Mutiny in the Army about the Arrears of Pay. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hermias</hi> perceiving the King to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and to ſeek what to do, made an Offer to him, propoſing to ſatisfie the Soldiers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears out of his own private Fortune, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he would yield that <hi>Epigences</hi> might not be employ'd in that Expedition; pretending, that the Differences which had happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, would be the occaſion of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, that would greatly hinder him in the management of his Affairs. The King, in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61906:377"/>truth, lent a very unwilling Ear to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, believing it to be for his Service to take <hi>Epigenes</hi> with him, who was well ſeen in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Matters, and in every thing an able Counſellor; but won by the Artifices of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias,</hi> who had gain'd likewiſe thoſe about him, he was not Maſter of his own Reſolutions: Wherefore yielding to preſent Neceſſity, he comply'd with the Demand of <hi>Hermias.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Epigenes</hi> retir'd to <hi>Apamea,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the Orders he receiv'd from the King.</p>
                     <p>All of the King's Council were ill ſatisfy'd with this Reſolution, while, on the other hand, the Soldiers, who had receiv'd ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Demands, expreſs'd great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards <hi>Hermias,</hi> by whoſe means they had obtain'd their Arrears. Nor was there any remaining Stirs, ſaving among the <hi>Cyrrheſtae,</hi> of whom there revolted from the King's Service to the number of Six Thouſand, who for a while gave him ſome Trouble; but being purſu'd and attack'd, they were defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that were ſent againſt them, the greateſt part being cut off, and the remainder returning to their Obedience.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Hermias,</hi> having ſubdu'd thoſe about the King by his Authority, and gain'd the Good-will of the Soldiers by his Bounty, departed with <hi>Antiochus</hi> and the Army; but forgot not, by means of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who was Governour of the Citadel of <hi>Apamea,</hi> to form
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61906:377"/>this Deſign for the Deſtruction of <hi>Epigenes.</hi> He forg'd a Letter from <hi>Molon</hi> to <hi>Epigenes;</hi> and having corrupted one of his Servants by Promiſes of a great Reward, gives him the Letter, with Orders to lay it among the reſt of his Maſter's Papers. Whereupon <hi>Alexis</hi> comes to <hi>Epigenes,</hi> and demands of him if he had not receiv'd Letters from <hi>Molon?</hi> To which <hi>Epigenes</hi> reply'd with Indignation, That he held no intercourſe with Rebels. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi> boldly affirming the contrary, demanded leave to ſearch; and ent'ring by force into his Lodgings, he found the Letter; with which pretext he immediately kill'd <hi>Epigenes</hi> on the place, the King being perſwaded to think him Guilty. And tho' the principal Men about him were aw'd into Silence, and did not dare to move therein, nevertheleſs the Action gave them great Jealouſie and Offence.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Army's arrival at <hi>Euphrates, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> join'd the Troops that he found there, and purſu'd his march; and coming near <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> in <hi>Mygdonia,</hi> Winter being now at hand, he there remain'd till the Colds were over, and in forty Days after arriv'd at <hi>Liba.</hi> Here he fell to deliberate with his Officers what courſe was beſt to take to find out <hi>Molon,</hi> and by what means they ſhould ſuſtain the Army in their march; for <hi>Molon</hi> was in poſſeſſion of all the Country about <hi>Babylon. Hermias</hi> propos'd to keep along the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> by which means they ſhould have the benefit of

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pros,</hi> to cover and defend their Camp. But <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> tho' he wanted aſſurance to deliver his Mind as he ought, having the Fate of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> before his Eyes; nevertheleſs, ſuch was the Weakneſs and Danger of <hi>Hermias</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that with ſome difficulty he reply'd, That there was a neceſſity of their paſſing the <hi>Tigris;</hi> and made appear the great Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they ſhould meet with, in holding their march along the River. He principally urg'd, that after a long and tedious Journey, and a march of ſix Days through a continu'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, they would come to a place call'd, <hi>The King's Ditch;</hi> which place, if it ſhould chance to be poſſeſs'd by the Enemy, would entirely bar their further Progreſs; which might be the means of expoſing the Army to great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by their being compell'd to return by the Deſart, where (which was eſpecially to be conſider'd) they ſhould be reduc'd to want every needful thing. On the other hand, he made appear, That in caſe they paſs'd the <hi>Tigris,</hi> it was more than probable, that thoſe of the Country of <hi>Apollonia</hi> would ſee their Error, and return to their Duty, who, it was plain, were compell'd, and not out of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, but out of Fear and Neceſſity, had taken part with <hi>Molon.</hi> Furthermore, being to march through a plentiful Country, there would be no danger of being driven to ſtreights for any thing. And what was of further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61906:378"/>when <hi>Molon</hi> ſhould ſee his paſſage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Advice of <hi>Zeuxes</hi> was approv'd, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to which the Army being divided into three Bodies, they paſs'd over the Troops with their Baggage in three ſeveral places. So they proſecuted their march towards <hi>Dura,</hi> which was at that time ſtreighten'd by one of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s Officers, who on their approach left the Siege. Then continuing their march with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out halting, they paſs'd by <hi>Oricum</hi> in eight Days and came to <hi>Apollonia.</hi> And now <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> being inform'd of the King's Arrival, and not being very well aſſur'd of the Good-will of the <hi>Suſians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> whom he had but lately reduc'd, and who were ſurpriz'd into ſubmiſſion; and further, fearing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies deſign of blocking up his Paſſage back into <hi>Media,</hi> he reſolv'd to lay a Bridge over the <hi>Tigris,</hi> and paſſing his Army, determin'd to gain the Mountains of <hi>Apollonia</hi> before <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> ſhould arrive; for he rely'd much on his Slingers, which they call <hi>Cyrthii.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon putting in execution what had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, he march'd the Army away with great diligence. But the King chancing to move with all his Troops about the ſame time from
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61906:379"/>
                        <hi>Apollonia,</hi> that <hi>Molon</hi>'s Army approach'd the Mountains, certain advanc'd Parties of choice Men of either Army happen'd to meet on the Hills. Theſe had ſome diſpute, and pickeer'd for a while, but on the approach of the groſs of the Army, they retir'd, and the two Armies Encamp'd about five Miles aſunder. But <hi>Molon,</hi> during the Night made reflection, how dangerous it was for Men in Rebellion to march againſt their Prince in broad-day and give him Battel; wherefore he became of Opinion, that the much ſafer courſe would be to fall on <hi>Antiochus</hi> by Night, which was accordingly reſolv'd; ſo detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Body of ſelect Troops, he lead them by ſecret ways towards the Mountains, and from thence determin'd to fall on the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp from high Ground. But while he was on his March, he was given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, That Ten of his People had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and ſtole away to the King; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſiſted, and return'd back by the way he came; but coming to the Camp about break of Day, he fill'd the whole Army with Fear and Tumult: For being ſurpriz'd and awaken'd with the Noiſe, the Terror grew to that degree, that they had like to have abandon'd their Works; but by <hi>Molon</hi>'s Care and Diligence all was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd.</p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:61906:379"/>
                     <p>In the mean while the King, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to come to a Battel, order'd his Troops to march out by break of day. On the right of the Battel he rang'd the Lanciers under the Leading of <hi>Ardyes,</hi> of whoſe Conduct in War he had receiv'd ſufficient Proofs. After theſe he poſted the <hi>Candiots,</hi> who had been ſent purſuant to the Treaty of Peace. Theſe were join'd by the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Tectoſages;</hi> and next theſe he plac'd the Mercenary Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who were brought from <hi>Greece.</hi> The King himſelf was at the head of a ſtrong Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, where the <hi>Cohorts</hi> were diſpos'd after the ſame manner. On the left he poſted the Horſe, that are call'd the <hi>Troops of the King's Allies,</hi> ordering his Elephants by tens, with Intervals between them, a little advanc'd before the Battel. On the Wings were poſted the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliary Troops, both Horſe and Foot, who had Orders to attack the Enemy in Flank, as ſoon as the Battel ſhould begin. Then the King going from Rank to Rank, ſpoke to the Soldiers, and in few words, as the time and occaſion permitted, animated them to their Duty. He gave the leading of the Left-Wing to <hi>Hermias</hi> and <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> remaining himſelf in the Right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Molon</hi> alſo march'd out his Army, and rang'd them with difficulty enough, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the laſt Night's diſorder; nevertheleſs, he form'd his Troops according to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the other Army had taken, and plac'd
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61906:380"/>his Buckler-men, <hi>Galatians,</hi> and heavy-arm'd Soldiers in the Centre. He diſtributed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Slingers, and all his light-arm'd Troops without the Horſe, on the Right and Left; poſted his Chariots arm'd with Sithes, advanc'd before the Line of Battel. He gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Left to <hi>Neolaus</hi> his Brother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Right to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Being thus drawn up, the Battel began; and, in a word, the Right of <hi>Molon</hi>'s Army preſerv'd their Fidelity to the laſt, engaging <hi>Zeuxes</hi> with great Reſolution. But the Left no ſooner advanc'd near the King, when they deſerted and went over to him; which Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as it greatly terrify'd <hi>Molon</hi>'s Army, ſo it increas'd the Courage of the King's. And now <hi>Molon,</hi> beholding himſelf deſerted, and as it were abandon'd on all ſides, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Puniſhment that awaited him, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall alive into the Enemies hands, kill'd himſelf; and all who had been Complices with him, and cou'd eſcape home, ended their Days after the like manner. <hi>Neolaus</hi> ſaving himſelf out of the Battel, got into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and came to <hi>Alexander</hi> his Brother, where he kill'd the Wife and Children of <hi>Molon,</hi> and afterwards dy'd himſelf on their dead Bodies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſuaded <hi>Alexander</hi> to do the like. After the King had pillag'd the Enemies Camp, he order'd <hi>Molon</hi>'s Body to be fix'd on a Croſs, and plac'd on one of the higheſt Mountains of <hi>Media;</hi> which was immediately put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61906:380"/>the Body being carry'd into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Chalonitidi,</hi> and plac'd on the moſt conſpicuous part of the Mountain <hi>Zagra,</hi> where where was fix'd on a Croſs.</p>
                     <p>As to the Rebel-Army, after the King had ſeverely reprov'd them, he vouchſaf'd them his Pardon; appointing certain Officers to lead them back into <hi>Media,</hi> who were to remain there to regulate the Affairs of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the King return'd to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia,</hi> where he apply'd himſelf to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Affairs of the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, practiſing his cuſtomary Prudence and Clemency. As to <hi>Hermias,</hi> he continu'd the ſame Man ſtill, loading the <hi>Seleucians</hi> with many Accuſations, and condemning them in a Fine of two thouſand Talents, ſending their <hi>Diganes</hi> (for ſo their Magiſtrates are call'd) into Baniſhment; and exerciſing his natural Cruelty on many of the Citizens, diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring ſome, and putting others to death. But in the end the King's Humanity prevail'd, and put a period to thoſe Evils, ſometimes by ordering things his own way, ſometimes by interpoſing to ſoften the Severities of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias;</hi> and contented himſelf with diminiſhing the Mulct of the <hi>Seleucians</hi> to five hundred Talents; on the payment whereof he receiv'd them into Grace.</p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:61906:381"/>
                     <p>After theſe things, <hi>Diogenes</hi> being left Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in <hi>Media, Apollodorus</hi> in <hi>Suſa,</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> the King's Chancellor being ſent into the Countries bordering on the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Period was given to the Rebellion of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and all the Troubles that fell out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon were compos'd. <hi>Antiochus</hi> encourag'd by this Succeſs, that he might terrifie the Princes of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> bordering on his Dominions, and deterr them for the future from taking part with his Rebellious Subjects, or entring into Alliance with them, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to invade them. And firſt he propos'd to attack <hi>Artabazanes,</hi> who was eſteem'd ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the reſt both in Power and Military Abilities, being over and above Lord of that People they call <hi>Atropatii,</hi> and other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations. But <hi>Hermias</hi> unwillingly engag'd in that War, as well in regard of the Danger it threatned, as for that his Mind was more bent on that againſt <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> according to the Reſolution that had been formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: Nevertheleſs, on the News of the Queen's having brought a Son, and conceiving the King would run ſome hazard of his Perſon in a War with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he came to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Propoſition of invading them, in hopes of being deliver'd of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that in caſe he could by any means be rid of him, the Government of the Empire, and Tuition of the Infant-Prince would fall to his ſhare. Wherefore after all things were
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61906:381"/>prepar'd for the Expedition, the Army march'd over the Mountain <hi>Zagra,</hi> and fell on the Territory ſubject to <hi>Artabazanes.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lies on the Borders of the <hi>Medes,</hi> ſeparated only by a ridge of Hills that lie between them. It extends on the one ſide to the <hi>Pontus,</hi> where the River <hi>Phaſis</hi> runs into that Sea; and ſtretcheth as far as the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. The Region abounds in good Soldiers, eſpecially Horſe; it is plentifully ſtor'd with Proviſions, and all things needful to ſuſtain a War, the Kingdom having continu'd ever ſince the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, having it ſeems been neglected by <hi>Alexander.</hi> But <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi> being old, and towards the period of his Days, and terrify'd it the Kings arrival, thought it ſafeſt to ſubmit, and purchaſe Peace with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> on whatſoever Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he ſhould pleaſe to impoſe.</p>
                     <p>After this Affair was accommodated, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophanes,</hi> the King's beloved Phyſician, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Hermias</hi> to aſpire yet beyond that degree of Power and Greatneſs to which he had been rais'd, began to fear, and take thought for the King's ſafety and his own; wherefore taking a proper occaſion, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted his Jealouſie to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> praying him not to rely over-confidently on <hi>Hermias</hi>'s Fidelity, concerning which, there wanted not grounds of diſtruſt: That, in ſhort, it behov'd him to be on his guard, and not to defer the means of his Preſervation, leſt he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61906:382"/>fell into the like Snare with his Brother: He told him he thought the Danger at hand; wherefore he conjur'd him to determine with ſpeed touching the means of his own and his Friends Preſervation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antiochus</hi> hereupon diſſembled not to his Phyſician the Hatred he bare to <hi>Hermias,</hi> and that he had long entertain'd ſuſpicious Thoughts of him: He told him he took in good part his care for his ſafety, and prais'd his Reſolution in opening ſo frankly his Thoughts. This Diſcourſe confirm'd <hi>Apolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> that he had oblig'd the King, and that his Sentiments were conformable with his own; which gave him both Joy and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. In concluſion, <hi>Antiochus</hi> enjoining him to have a careful eye to his and his Friends Preſervation, not only in words, but in effect. And <hi>Apollophanes</hi> manifeſting his readineſs to act any part to inſure his ſafety, they came, after a long conference, to agree, That the King ſhould feign himſelf indiſpos'd in his Head, inſomuch that for a while none were to be admitted to his Chamber. Howbeit, at length ſuch of the King's Servants as he moſt eſteem'd, were to be permitted to wait on him; by which means they dealt apart with ſuch as they thought fit; and when they had imparted the Conſpiracy to thoſe who were propos'd to be engag'd, (which was not hard to bring to paſs through the general Hatred <hi>Hermias</hi> had contracted) they deliberated
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61906:382"/>how to put it in execution. The Phyſicians then advis'd the King to take the Morning's Air, while the Seaſon was yet cool, and to walk abroad early: So that <hi>Hermias</hi> was not wanting to give his attendance at the Hour appointed; and with him thoſe to whom the King had communicated his purpoſe, but none elſe, in regard the King's walking out was deſign'd to be ſooner than ordinary. Thus <hi>Hermias</hi> was led abroad; and coming to a lonely place, where the King ſtepping aſide, as on ſome neceſſary occaſion, he was in the mean time kill'd by thoſe who were about him; a Puniſhment in truth too gentle for his Crimes.</p>
                     <p>The King now deliver'd of this Troubler of his Affairs, reſolv'd to lead his Army home, all the Provinces through which he paſs'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him with Acclamations of Praiſe, and applauding principally his Juſtice in taking <hi>Hermias</hi> out of the World; whoſe Wife and Children were at the ſame time ſton'd to death by the Women of <hi>Apamea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s return home, he diſpos'd his Army into Winter-Quarters, and ſent to expoſtulate with <hi>Achoeus</hi> about his invading the Crown, and preſuming to call himſelf King. Afterwards he let him underſtand, that the League he had made with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> was come to his knowledge; and charg'd him with many other Acts contrary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and in violation of his Duty. It ſeems
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61906:383"/>that at what time the War was undertaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Artabazanes; Achoeus</hi> imagining the King might miſcarry in that Expedition; and tho' that ſhould not happen, yet the King being thereby drawn ſo far out of the way, would give him a ſafe opportunity to fall on <hi>Syria,</hi> and ſeize on that Kingdom for himſelf, aided therein by the <hi>Cyrrhestoe,</hi> who at that time had withdrawn their Obedience from the King: Wherefore with this Determination he march'd his Army out of <hi>Lydia.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he caus'd himſelf to be Crown'd at <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> receiving and giving Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Ambaſſadors; and in his Letters to the Cities, he aſſum'd the Regal Title; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd principally into this Attempt by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations of a certain Exile call'd <hi>Syniris.</hi> But after ſome days march, and that they now approach'd <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> there happen'd a Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in his Army, the Soldiers refuſing, it ſeems, to be led againſt him, whom Nature had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd for their King. Whereupon <hi>Achoeus</hi> perceiving the Army to have chang'd their Mind, chang'd alſo his Purpoſe; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them that he never deſign'd to invade <hi>Syria,</hi> he took another way, and march'd and plunder'd <hi>Piſidia.</hi> After which Expedition, having inrich'd the Soldiers with Booty, and confirm'd their Affection, he return'd home.</p>

                     <p>The King then, who was well inform'd of all theſe Paſſages, had, as was noted, let <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choeus</hi> know ſo much by menacing Meſſages, and in the mean while prepar'd for the War againſt <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> To which purpoſe, early in the Spring, he aſſembled his Troops at <hi>Apamea,</hi> and call'd a Council to deliberate on the beſt way to make his entrance for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading of <hi>Syria;</hi> on which ſubject were long Debates of the Nature of the Country, Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Places; of the Proviſion to make, and of what Benefit a Fleet would be towards the furtherance of the Enterprize. But the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Apollophanes</hi> the <hi>Seleucian,</hi> the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian we have already had occaſion to name, prevail'd above the reſt; who maintain'd, that the Deſign on <hi>Caelo-Syria</hi> was vain; and it would be an unprofitable Expedition to make War there, while they left <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in quiet poſſeſſion of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> a Royal City, and in effect the Metropolis of the Kingdom: That not to mention the Diſhonour to have that City in the hands of an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> King, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery thereof would redound greatly to the Service of the King's Affairs in many Points: That in the interim, while it remain'd in the Enemies hands, it would be a mighty Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the progreſs of the King's Succeſs in the Enterprize he was upon: For which way ſoever he had a mind to carry the War, he would find it neceſſary (over and above all other Preparations) to ſtrengthen all his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61906:384"/>Towns with extraordinary Garriſons, meerly on the account of the Danger that would threaten from <hi>Seleucia:</hi> But that if <hi>Antiochus</hi> made the recovery of that Place his firſt Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it would not only ſerve as a Bulwark and Frontier againſt all the other Towns of the Kingdom, but would mainly enable him to proſecute his Enterprize both by Sea and Land.</p>
                     <p>The Opinion of <hi>Apollophanes</hi> then was by common Conſent approv'd; and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to open the Campaign with the Seige of <hi>Seleucia.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Garriſon in this Town, ever ſince <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> call'd <hi>Euergetes,</hi> offended with <hi>Seleucus</hi> for the Death of <hi>Berenice,</hi> became Maſter thereof; who on that Provocation, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Syria.</hi> When it was reſolv'd then, that <hi>Apollophanes</hi>'s Counſel ſhould be follow'd, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> order'd <hi>Diognetus</hi> his Admiral, to Sail with the Fleet to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> while himſelf march'd with the Army from <hi>Apamea,</hi> and came and Encamp'd near <hi>Circus. Theodotus</hi> was likewiſe ſent with a ſufficient Body of Troops into the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> with Orders to take Poſſeſſion of the Streights, and to have an Eye to all Motions in thoſe Parts. As to the Situation of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and the Country about it, take it a little more or leſs, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Seleucia</hi> ſtands on the Sea-Coaſt, on the Frontiers of <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> in the Neighbourhood of a very high Mountain
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61906:384"/>call'd <hi>Coryphoeus;</hi> one ſide of which Mountain towards the Weſt, is waſh'd by the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia;</hi> the other towards the Eaſt, regards the Territory of <hi>Seleucia</hi> and <hi>Antioch. Seleucia</hi> ſtands on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of this Mountain, between which and the City is a deep Vale, waſte and full of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ground, which extends to the Sea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd almoſt on all ſides with Rocks and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices. On that ſide of the City towards the Sea, the Ground is low and watery, where there is a Suburb Fortify'd with a good Wall, like that of the City it ſelf. <hi>Seleucia</hi> ſurpaſſes all the Cities of <hi>Syria</hi> in the Magnificence of her Temples and other Buildings. It hath but one Communication with the Sea, which is a Paſſage wrought out of the Rock in manner of Stairs. Not far off is ſeen the Mouth of the River <hi>Orontes,</hi> whoſe Head is in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Anti-Libanus,</hi> taking its Courſe through the Plain of <hi>Amycoe;</hi> and running to <hi>Antioch,</hi> divides that City as it were into two, which it cleanſes of all their Filth and Rubbiſh, and at length diſcharges it ſelf, not far from <hi>Seleucia,</hi> into the Sea we mention'd.</p>
                     <p>Now before <hi>Antiochus</hi> would proceed with Hoſtility againſt <hi>Seleucia,</hi> he firſt ſent Offers of Rewards to the Principal Men of the City, and Promiſes of further future Advantages, to win them to yield it up without ſtrife or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But finding he labour'd that way in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61906:385"/>vain, he corrupted ſeveral of their Military Officers, who had Poſts diſtinct, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in ſundry Quarters of the City; and in confidence of their Compliance, drew out, and order'd his Troops as for an Attack. To the Seaward the Marine Forces were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; towards the Land, thoſe of the Camp were order'd to make the Aſſault. So mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Diviſions of his Army, and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Soldiers according to Cuſtom, and Proclaiming by a Herauld, Promiſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Recompences, as Crowns, and ſuch like Rewards to the Officers and Soldiers, who ſhould beſt behave themſelves. He gave to <hi>Xeuxes,</hi> and thoſe under him, the Attack of the Gate that leads to <hi>Antioch;</hi> to <hi>Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> that of thoſe parts that are neareſt the Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux;</hi> and to <hi>Ardys</hi> and <hi>Diognetus,</hi> the Ars'nal and Suburbs; for it was agreed with the Conſpirators, that as ſoon as the Suburbs ſhould be won, the Town ſhould be Surrendred. And now the Signal being given, the Attack began in all places at once, and was preſs'd with great forwardneſs and bravery. But <hi>Ardys</hi> and <hi>Diognetus</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd themſelves above the reſt, both in Reſolution and Addreſs. Tho' indeed in other places they could not come to the foot of the Wall to erect their Ladders, without coming to Blows with the Enemy; but at the Ars'nal and Suburbs they approach'd, and apply'd their Ladders without Impediment: So that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61906:385"/>while the Marine Soldiers Scal'd the Ars'nal, and <hi>Ardys</hi> the Suburbs, and thoſe of the Town not being able to come to their Relief, being themſelves preſs'd on all Quarters, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys,</hi> after ſome Diſpute, became Maſter of the Suburbs; whereupon the Officers who had been gain'd by the King, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſeveral Poſts of the City, came to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius</hi> the Governour, preſſing their Opinion, that there was now no ſafe way left, but to ſend immediately to the King to Treat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town ſhould be taken by Aſſault: Whereupon <hi>Leontius,</hi> who was ignorant of the Treachery, being frighted with their ſeeming Fear, diſpatch'd a Meſſage to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> with Propoſals of Conditions that no Violence ſhould be done to any, and that the Inhabitants ſhould be Safe in their Perſons.</p>
                     <p>The King on ſight of the Propoſals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that no manner of Injury ſhould be done to any one of free Condition, which were to the number of Six Thouſand. And in a word, when the Place was deliver'd up, he did not only deal graciouſly with thoſe, but recall'd their Exiles, and reſtor'd the City to its Privileges, and the Inhabitants to their Eſtates and Authority, leaving only Garriſons both in the Port and Citadel. While the King was buſied in theſe Affairs, Letters were brought him from <hi>Theodotus,</hi> by which he was Solicited to march with what Expedition he could into <hi>Syria,</hi> giving him aſſurance that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61906:386"/>on his Arrival, he would deliver the Kingdom intirely to his Poſſeſſion. This News gave the King ſome trouble and ſuſpence, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what to reſolve, on the intimation he had receiv'd. <hi>Theodotus</hi> was by Birth an <hi>Aetolian,</hi> who tho' he had done Eminent Service to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings, nevertheleſs his Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not only ſhort of his Merits, but coming to Court, as we have elſewhere noted, he there ran great hazard of his life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when <hi>Antiochus</hi> was on his Expedition againſt <hi>Molon, Theodotus</hi> having no very good opinion of the ſtate of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Affairs, and jealous of his Intereſt at Court, had himſelf taken <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> and won <hi>Tyre</hi> by the help of <hi>Panoetolus,</hi> and had now earneſtly invited <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Who therefore reſpiting for that time his Expedition againſt <hi>Achoeus,</hi> and all his other Affairs; he march'd with his Army, taking the ſame way he had gone before. And having paſs'd the Valley of <hi>Marſyas,</hi> he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd near the Streight, where the Fortreſs of <hi>Gerra</hi> ſtands, along the ſide of the Lake, between the Mountains. There he receiv'd notice that <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> one of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, had laid Seige to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> was ſhut up; wherefore leaving his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-arm'd Troops behind, and giving Orders for the Beſieging the Caſtle of <hi>Brochos,</hi> that commanded the Paſſage by the Lake, he march'd at the Head of his light-arm'd Forces to raiſe the Seige of <hi>Ptolemais. Nicolaus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61906:386"/>Intelligence of the King's approach, decamp'd from before the Town, and ſent <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> a <hi>Candiot,</hi> and <hi>Dorymenes</hi> an <hi>Aetolian,</hi> to poſſeſs the Streight near <hi>Berytus.</hi> But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> haſting after them, forc'd them to a Battel, where they were beaten; ſo the King himſelf Encamp'd in the Streight. In which place aſſembling the whole Army, after he had encourag'd them, he proſecuted his March with the intire Body of his Troops, full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of great Succeſs, whereof there were already ſo many promiſing appearances. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> and <hi>Panoetolus,</hi> accompany'd by their Friends, coming out to meet the King, were receiv'd by him with great Courteſie, to whom they deliver'd up <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> with all the Stores of War that were there lodg'd; among other things they found, there were forty Gallies, whereof twenty were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd and equipp'd for the Sea, and none were leſs than Quadriremes; the other were Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remes, and Veſſels of leſs Rates; theſe were committed to <hi>Diognetus</hi> the King's Admiral.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Antiochus</hi> being inform'd that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was gone to <hi>Memphis,</hi> that his Troops were aſſembling at <hi>Peluſium,</hi> and that they had opened the Canals of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and let looſe all their Water-Courſes; he thereupon chaing'd his purpoſe of marching to <hi>Peluſium,</hi> and divided his Army, reſolv'd to attempt the Towns by the way; ſome by fair means, ſome by force. Such Places as were not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61906:387"/>Garriſon'd for Defence, were on his arrival frighted into Submiſſion, and putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under his Protection, Courted his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but ſuch as had Men and Proviſions within, and thought themſelves able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, preſerv'd their Obedience to their Prince; inſomuch, that the King ſpent much time and labour to reduce them.</p>
                     <p>At to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf, who was manifeſtly betray'd, he took little or no thought for the better poſture of his Affairs; nor dream'd of approaching the Enemy, as he ought to have done; ſuch was his ſtupidity, and the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ever had to Military Employments: Wherefore <hi>Agathocles</hi> and <hi>Soſibius,</hi> who were at that time in prime Authority, having the intire Adminiſtration of the Publick in their Hands, fell at length to deliberate with the beſt Advice they could. They reſolv'd to make all poſſible Preparations for Defence; and to win Time, concluded to ſend Overtures to <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and to proceed in ſuch manner, as to poſſeſs him with aſſurance, that he was not at all miſtaken in the Mind of <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> namely, that he would never reſolve to meet him in the Field, but endeavour by Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Mediation to diſſuade his Enterprize on <hi>Syria.</hi> This Counſel being approv'd, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi> and <hi>Soſibius,</hi> to whom a ſhare of the Management likewiſe was committed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd Ambaſſadors to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and ſo wrought that the <hi>Rhodians, Byzantines, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zicenians,</hi>
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:61906:387"/>and the <hi>Aetolians</hi> themſelves, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd their Ambaſſadors to Mediate a Peace. In ſomuch, that on their arrival, the time that was taken up in Treating and Journeying from one King to another, lent ſpace ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for <hi>Soſibius</hi> and <hi>Agathocles</hi> to proſecute their Preparations for the War. Their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was at <hi>Memphis,</hi> where they held their Conferences with the Ambaſſadors, according to the Emergency of Affairs; and where they receiv'd and treated with the Miniſters of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus.</hi> But while theſe were well receiv'd, and civilly entertain'd, and held in hand, all the Mercenary Strangers, which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had in his Towns and Garriſons throughout the Countries of his Dominion, were aſſembled at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Furthermore, they ſent every where to levy Troops, taking care above all things, that due Proviſion might be made as well to ſuſtain thoſe they had already in Pay, as thoſe whom they expected. Nor were they leſs mindful of every other Point that might require their Application to advance their Purpoſe; ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other, going to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to provide that nothing might be wanting towards the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of what had been reſolv'd. To <hi>Eche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> the <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> and <hi>Phoxides</hi> the <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> was committed the Care of providing Arms, raiſing Men, and forming their Troops; who were aſſiſted by <hi>Eurylochus</hi> the <hi>Magneſian,</hi> together with <hi>Socrates</hi> the <hi>Boeotian, Cnopias</hi>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:61906:388"/>and <hi>Aloritas.</hi> In ſhort, it was a mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to be furniſh'd with thoſe Men who had ſerv'd under <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and who were at leaſt ſeen in ſome degree in the Conduct of Battels and Military Expeditions. Theſe then proceeded to provide for the War as faſt as they could Exerciſe and Diſcipline the Soldiers, that were committed to their Care.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they caus'd them to be diſtributed according to their Age, then they arm'd them after ſuch manner as they judg'd proper, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them ſuch Arms as they had before been us'd to. They aboliſh'd the old way of drawing up in Battel, which had been obſerv'd on the review of their Armies; when they Pay'd the Soldiers, and Model'd them in ſuch ſort, as beſt ſuited with the Service they were to go upon. Then they accuſtom'd them to the Word of Command, wherein their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers kept them in perpetual Exerciſe; inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them likewiſe in the uſe and management of thoſe Arms they were appointed to carry. At other times they caus'd the whole Army to be drawn up in one place, and Exercis'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; wherein <hi>Andromachus</hi> the <hi>Aſpendian,</hi> and <hi>Polycrates</hi> of <hi>Argos,</hi> who were newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd out of <hi>Greece,</hi> were imploy'd above the reſt. Theſe had truly the Courage and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of <hi>Greeks,</hi> and well knew how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it in occaſions of War. Furthermore, they were Men of Experience, and both Eminent
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61906:388"/>by the Reputation of their Country, and the Quality of their Perſons. <hi>Polycrates</hi> was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſiderable by the Antiquity of his Family, and the Character of <hi>Mnaſias</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had often won the Prize in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games. Thus then the Officers Exerciſing and Animating ſometimes in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſometimes in Particular, the Soldiers who were reſpectively put under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they became bold and expert for the Service wherein they were to be imploy'd.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, ev'ry one of thoſe we have nam'd, had their particular Poſts and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Army, ſuited to their Talents and Capacity. <hi>Eurylochus</hi> the <hi>Magneſian</hi> had the Command of three thouſand Men, being of thoſe Troops of the King's Houſhold, call'd <hi>Agema. Socrates</hi> the <hi>Boeotian,</hi> Commanded two thouſand Buckler-men. <hi>Phoxidas</hi> the <hi>Achaian,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Son of <hi>Thraſea,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Andromachus</hi> the <hi>Aſpendian,</hi> had the like Charge in the Phalanx and the <hi>Greek</hi> Mercenaries. But <hi>Andromachus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had the prime Commands in the Phalanx, and <hi>Phoxidas</hi> of the Mercenaries. The Phalanx was Compos'd of about five and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men: The Mercenaries amounted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight thouſand: The Horſe of the King's Houſhold came to about ſeven hundred, who were led by <hi>Polycrates,</hi> together with thoſe who were brought from <hi>Libya;</hi> and that were rais'd in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> making in all to the number
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61906:389"/>of three thouſand Men. But <hi>Echecrates</hi> the <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> had the Command of the <hi>Groecian</hi> Horſe, and the reſt of the Foreign Cavalry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of two thouſand in all. And as he had taken great pains in Exerciſing and Diſciplining them, ſo was his Care viſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd in the Service they afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to <hi>Ptolomy. Cnopias</hi> alſo the <hi>Aloritan,</hi> yielded to none in his Diligence, in Training and Inſtructing thoſe who were committed to his Charge; who were a Body of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Candiots,</hi> among whom were a thouſand new-rais'd Men, which he put under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Philo</hi> a <hi>Cnoſſian.</hi> There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe three thouſand <hi>Africans,</hi> Arm'd after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> manner, whoſe Chief was <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the <hi>Baroean.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Troops, or Phalanx, amounted to twenty thouſand, the Command of which Body <hi>Soſibius</hi> reſerv'd to himſelf. They aſſembled likewiſe of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> Subjects of King <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s, to the number of three thouſand; and more, two thouſand new-rais'd Men of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; theſe were put under the leading of <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>Thrace.</hi> The Army of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> then was Compos'd of this number, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers People we have recited.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in the mean time, laid cloſe ſiege to <hi>Dura;</hi> but that attempt not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Place being ſtrong of it ſelf, and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus</hi> finding ways to recruit and ſupply them from time to time, he therefore accorded to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61906:389"/>
                        <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Ambaſſadors (who arriv'd the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Winter) a Truce of four Months; telling them, it would not be through his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, if a Peace did not follow. Nevertheleſs, in that he ſpake not his Mind; but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing longer to be detain'd out of his own Dominions, he was earneſt to withdraw his Army to <hi>Seleucia</hi> to their Winter-Quarters. Furthermore, there were grounds of ſuſpicion that <hi>Achoeus</hi> (whom none doubted took part with <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) was practiſing Deſigns againſt the King.</p>
                     <p>In concluſion, <hi>Antiochus</hi> having granted the Demands of the Ambaſſadors, diſmiſs'd them, with Injunctions to let him know ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily the Reſolution of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> requiring them to meet him on their return at <hi>Seleucia.</hi> Then putting Garriſons into proper places, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Theodotus</hi> in the chief Command, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for his return home. As ſoon as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> he diſpatch'd his Army into Winter-Quarters; where during their abode, but little care was taken to train and keep them in good Diſcipline; he holding his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that there would be but little occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fighting, to finiſh what he had begun: For being already poſſeſs'd of a good part of the <hi>Lower Syria</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> he made no great doubt of acquiring eaſily the reſt; and that what remain'd in Diſpute, would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Treaty and Conference; and that <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> would never be drawn to Diſpute with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61906:390"/>him in the Field. The Ambaſſadors were likewiſe of his Opinion; for <hi>Soſibius,</hi> who held the Treaty at <hi>Memphis,</hi> had entertain'd them with all poſſible Deference and Reſpect; and had manag'd his Affairs in ſuch ſort, that none of thoſe, who had been ſent to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> were able to obtain the leaſt information of the Preparations that were making at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria:</hi> Wherefore the Ambaſſadors, at their return, declar'd that <hi>Soſibius</hi> was ready to yield every thing.</p>
                     <p>'Tis obſervable, that in all the Conferences <hi>Antiochus</hi> had with the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> he ſeem'd moſt carefully to inſiſt on the advantage of the Right he had, as well as the Succeſs of his Arms, againſt his Adverſary. And on the arrival of his Ambaſſadors at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia,</hi> when they came to treat about the Conditions of the Peace, purſuant to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they had receiv'd from <hi>Soſibius,</hi> the King made but very little account of the violence that had been acted againſt <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> whereof the whole World was witneſs, in his ſeizing of Towns in the <hi>Lower Syria;</hi> but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently boaſted of that Expedition, affirming he had done no wrong therein to any Man, having but barely attempted the recovery of his Right; and that <hi>Antigonus, Cocles,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who were the firſt Conquerors of that Province, were the rightful Maſters, and that therein conſiſted the force of his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> in oppoſition to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61906:390"/>
                        <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s. He further ſaid, that it was true that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> wag'd War with <hi>Antigonus;</hi> but it was not for Dominion, but meerly as a Friend and Ally of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to whom that Country appertain'd. Then he referr'd to the Accord made by the ſeveral Princes; at what time <hi>Antigonus</hi> being defeated and vanquiſh'd, <hi>Caſſander, Lyſimachus,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi> met in a General Aſſembly, to deliberate on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when the entire Kingdom of <hi>Syria</hi> was adjudg'd to <hi>Seleucus.</hi> Thoſe who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on the part of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> labour'd to prove the contrary, and to ſhow the weakneſs of <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Pretenſions; and further to exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate the Injury, remonſtrated the Indignity of breaking the Peace, by the Treachery of <hi>Theodotus,</hi> and the Expedition of <hi>Antiochus:</hi> That <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus</hi> enter'd on the War for the acquiſition of <hi>Syria:</hi> That he join'd his Arms with <hi>Seleucus</hi> conditionally, that as the Dominion of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſhould be his, ſo the <hi>Lower Syria</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia</hi> ſhould fall to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s ſhare. The ſeveral Ambaſſadors urg'd theſe and the like Reaſons in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that were held; but no fruit came of their Debates, through want of one common Mediator: For while Matters were canvas'd by People equally intereſs'd and partial to their own ſide, without any one to moderate the Heats that could not but grow between them, what ſucceſs could be hop'd? The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of <hi>Achoeus</hi> was likewiſe a great clog to the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61906:391"/>Negotiation: For <hi>Ptolomy</hi> urg'd to have him compriz'd in the Treaty; but <hi>Antiochus</hi> could not brook ſo much as to hear him nam'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming how ſcandalous it was that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſhould entertain ſo much as a thought of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving protection to one in Rebellion againſt his Prince.</p>
                     <p>Thus while theſe two Princes built on the Equity of their Allegations, the Treaty was defeated; and early in the Spring <hi>Antiochus</hi> aſſembled his Troops, with intention to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Enemy by Sea and Land, and to proſecute his Conqueſt of what remain'd to be reduc'd of <hi>Caelo-Syria. Ptolomy,</hi> on the other part, committing his Affairs in thoſe parts to the Conduct of <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> furniſh'd <hi>Gaza</hi> plentifully with every needful thing for its defence, mov'd alſo with his Sea and Land Forces. On their arrival, <hi>Nicholaus</hi> prepar'd with determination to abide the War; and was readily ſupply'd in all his Demands by <hi>Perigenes,</hi> to whom <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had given the Command of the Fleet and Naval Army, which conſiſted of thirty Veſſels of War, and four hundred of Burthen. <hi>Nicholaus</hi> was an <hi>Aetolian</hi> by Nation, very brave, and in the Trade of War ſuperiour in Knowledge to moſt, who at that time were in the Service of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy.</hi> His firſt care was with part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to poſſeſs the Streights near <hi>Platanos,</hi> poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with the other part of his Army in the places near <hi>Porphyreon,</hi> to prevent any
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61906:391"/>attempt of <hi>Antiochus</hi> on that ſide. In the mean while, the Fleet remain'd at Anchor not far off.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s arrival at <hi>Marathum,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radians</hi> apply'd to him with Tenders of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Alliance; whom he did not only kindly receive, but interpos'd his Mediation between the Iſlanders, and thoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; compoſing the Difference that had happen'd between them, and eſtabliſhing Friendſhip among them. Then marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Syria,</hi> by that paſſage which is call'd <hi>Thoû<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſopon,</hi> he came to <hi>Berytus;</hi> took <hi>Botris</hi> in his march, and burnt <hi>Trieres</hi> and <hi>Calamus.</hi> From thence he diſpatch'd <hi>Theodotus</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carchus,</hi> with Orders to poſſeſs the Streights which lead to the River <hi>Lycus,</hi> to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with the Enemy. In the mean time, himſelf kept on his march with the Army, and came and Encamp'd by the River <hi>Damu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Diognetus,</hi> with the Fleet, keeping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near him. From thence, taking with him <hi>Nicarchus</hi> and <hi>Theodotus,</hi> with his light-arm'd Troops, he went to view the Streights where <hi>Nicholaus</hi> was poſted; and after he had made Remarks to his Mind, he return'd back to the Camp. The next Day, leaving <hi>Nicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> with the Command of his heavy-arm'd Troops behind, he march'd himſelf at the head of the reſt of the Army, to put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution what he had projected. Now, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> ſtreightens, and contracts
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61906:392"/>the paſſage by the Sea-Coaſt, and the ſpace is bounded by a Valley, waſte and inacceſſible, it comes to paſs, that the way between that and the Sea, is very narrow and difficult. Here it was where <hi>Nicolaus</hi> had poſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; where by placing good Guards in ſome places, and fortifying others with Works, he thought he ſhould be able, without much difficulty, to withſtand <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p>The King, in the mean time, diſpos'd his Army into three Diviſions; to <hi>Theodotus</hi> he gave the Command of one, with Orders to attack the Enemy that was poſted along the Mountain; another Diviſion he gave to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedemus,</hi> who was expreſly directed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Paſſage that lay in the middle of the Vale; the third he appointed for a reſerve, with reſpect to what might happen in the Naval Conflict: Theſe were lead by <hi>Diocles,</hi> who was Governour of the Country of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia</hi> near the <hi>Euphrates. Antiochus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf making choice of ſuch a place (attended only by his Guards) where he might ſtand and have a fair view of all that paſs'd on every ſide, whereby being a Spectator of each Mans behaviour, he was inabled to judge where to ſupply Succours in caſe of Need. And now <hi>Diognetus</hi> and <hi>Perigenes</hi> drew their Fleets into a Line of Battel, drawing as near the Shore as they could, inſomuch as the whole Action by Land and Sea became one ſingle
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61906:392"/>proſpect. When the Signal was given they advanc'd to the Attack on all ſides. The Fight at Sea continu'd for ſome time doubtful, their Forces being in every thing equal. And notwithſtanding <hi>Nicolaus</hi> ſeem'd a while to have the better, having the advantage of Ground; yet upon <hi>Theodotus</hi>'s forcing the Enemy from their Poſt on the Mountain, and from thence falling on the reſt, <hi>Nicolaus</hi> was compell'd to give Ground, and betake him to flight. About two thouſand were ſlain in the purſuit, and no fewer taken Priſoners, the reſt got into <hi>Sidon. Perigenes</hi> likewiſe, who once thought he had the better in the Naval Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, terrify'd to behold his Friends beaten a-ſhoar, left the Enemy a ſtern, and flying, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd himſelf in the ſame place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antiochus</hi> preſently thereupon leads his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Sidon,</hi> and encamps before the Town: But he thought it not adviſable to attack it; for as it was very well ſupply'd with all ſorts of Proviſions of War, ſo the Inhabitants were numerous, and their Strength re-inforc'd by thoſe who had fled thither after the Battel. From thence then he took his march towards <hi>Philoteria,</hi> ordering <hi>Diognetus</hi> his Admiral to make ſail with the Fleet to <hi>Tyre. Philoteria</hi> ſtands in the neighbourhood of a great Moor, through which runs the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> which from thence purſues its courſe through the Plains of <hi>Scythopolis. Antiochus</hi> becoming Maſter of the two foremention'd Places, grew
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61906:393"/>into greater aſſurance of ſucceeding in his Enterprizes, in regard the Territory ſubject to thoſe Towns produc'd ſufficient of all things to ſuſtain his Army, and yielded over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove enough of every thing he might need to proſecute his Deſign; wherefore after he had ſtrengthen'd them with good Garriſons, he took his march over the Mountains, and came to <hi>Atabyrium.</hi> This Town ſtands on a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ground, which by a gentle deſcent ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in a Plain, from whence to the top of the Eminence it is near two Miles. Here <hi>Antochus</hi> lodg'd an Ambuſh, which in effect won him the Place. For after by little Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and Diſputes he had drawn the People out, in one of theſe Ingagements, feigning to be too weak, his Party retreated, while the others purſu'd; when preſently facing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, the Enemy in their turn retir'd, who meeting the Ambuſh in Front, many were cut off; and, in ſhort, <hi>Antiochus</hi> himſelf purſuing the Advantage, ſo terrify'd them, that the Town was taken on the firſt Attack.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time <hi>Keroeas,</hi> one of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Captain, deſerted, and came over to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> whom receiving with great Solemnity, it gave occaſion for many other prime Officers of the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> to leave his Service. For ſhortly after <hi>Hippolochus</hi> the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> acted the ſame part, bringing with him to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four hundred Horſe. <hi>Antiochus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Garriſon'd <hi>Atabyrium,</hi> and purſuing his

                     <p>This great Succeſs ſo wrought on the Minds of the neighbouring People, that they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly took part with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whereby his Hopes increaſing, and his Power being augmented by this new acceſſion of his <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Friends; he advances into <hi>Galatis,</hi> which reducing, he took <hi>Abila,</hi> and in it thoſe who were come in to ſuccour it, under the leading of <hi>Nicias,</hi> a Kinſman and Confident of <hi>Menea</hi>'s. In ſhort, <hi>Gadara</hi> was the only Place that now remain'd to be reduc'd, which was eſteem'd the moſt conſiderable for Strength in all that Country. To this Town the King approach'd with his Army, and ſo terrify'd the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants with his preparations to Attack them, that they yielded themſelves up. And now being inform'd that great numbers of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy were drawn together in a certain Town of <hi>Arabia,</hi> call'd <hi>Rabath-ben-Ammon,</hi> or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batamana,</hi> from whence they made Excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and plundred the Country of thoſe who had contracted Friendſhip with him; he therefore laying aſide all his other Affairs, bent his march that way, and approach'd the Mountain whereon the Town ſtands. After he had view'd the ſituation on all ſides, he concluded there were but two places by which they could be attack'd; there then he poſted his Troops, and caus'd his Machines to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.

That Work done, the King continu'd his Attacks Night and Day, preſſing by all means poſſible to get into the Town; but therein they long labour'd in vain, by reaſon of the multitude of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.

                     <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Selgians</hi> had notice of the approach of theſe Succours, they march'd with the greateſt part of their Troops to poſſeſs the Streights, near a certain Place call'd by thoſe of the Country <hi>Climax,</hi> or the <hi>Ladder;</hi> poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Troops on the Paſſage, or Entrance hard by <hi>Saporda,</hi> breaking the Ground and barracadoing the Paſſages every where. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyeres,</hi> marching into the Territory of the <hi>Milyades,</hi> came and encamp'd near <hi>Cretom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis;</hi> and finding it was impoſſible for him to advance any further, for that the Enemy had every where made themſelves Maſters of the Defilées; he therefore devis'd this Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem: He caus'd his Troops to face about, and march back by the way they came, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhow, as if on finding the Ways ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd, that he could not march on, he had deſpair'd of his Deſign of relieving the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd.

                     <p>Here <hi>Theodotus</hi> gave an inſtance of <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Reſolution, and indeed worthy of a truly fearleſs Man: For having reſided heretofore in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Court, and being well acquainted with the Ways and Manners of that Prince, he got a little before Day-break into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp, with two Men only in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. It was not eaſie to know him by his Face, it being not yet Day; nor by his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, for that the Army conſiſted of great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Garbs. He having before obſerv'd where the King's Tent ſtood, for that they had frequently pickeer'd near that place, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd undiſcover'd, and entring the Tent where the King us'd to Eat, and give Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he ſearch'd every-where for him, but found him not; <hi>Ptolomy</hi> it ſeems having lain that Night elſewhere. Wherefore wounding only two Perſons, and killing <hi>Androeas</hi> the King's Phyſician, he retir'd in ſafety, having executed his Deſign, if we rightly weigh the Hazard, but fail'd only through want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation where the King was lodg'd.</p>
                     <p>After theſe two Princes had remain'd five Days thus near each other, they agreed to come to a deciſion. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> firſt march'd out, and ſoon after <hi>Antiochus</hi> appear'd in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. Their Bodies were compos'd of their Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanxes and choſen Troops, arm'd after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> manner, who were oppos'd one to another; their Wings were thus order'd, in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s <hi>Polycrates</hi> commanded the Left,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61906:401"/>with the Horſe that were under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and betwixt theſe and the Phalanx, firſt march'd the <hi>Candiots</hi> next to the Horſe: Theſe were follow'd by the Regiment of Guards, call'd <hi>Agema;</hi> after theſe march'd the Buckler-men, led by <hi>Socrates;</hi> then the <hi>Libyans,</hi> arm'd like <hi>Macedonians.</hi> The Right was led by <hi>Echecrates</hi> the <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> with the Horſe who were under his Command; on the Left next <hi>Echecrates</hi> march'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Thracians;</hi> then <hi>Phoxidas</hi> with his <hi>Greek</hi> Mercenaries; after theſe march'd the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Phalanx. They plac'd forty Elephants to cover the Left-Wing, where the King was to be, and the other thirty three ſtood on the Right to cover the Mercenary Horſe. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> thus order'd his Battel: On his Right he plac'd ſixty Elephants, to cover the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of that Wing, where he himſelf propos'd to ſtand, oppos'd to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> giving the Conduct to <hi>Philip</hi> his Foſter-Brother; in the Rear of theſe were poſted two thouſand Horſe, led by <hi>Antipater;</hi> next theſe were the like number drawn up in form of a Tenaile; after the Horſe ſtood the <hi>Candiots</hi> in front; then the <hi>Greek</hi> Mercenaries; betwixt theſe ſtood the five thouſand Men, that were arm'd like <hi>Macedonians,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Bytta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian.</hi> His Left-Wing conſiſted of two thouſand Horſe, led by <hi>Themiſon.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe were the <hi>Cardaces,</hi> the <hi>Lydian</hi> Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and next thoſe three thouſand light-arm'd,

The Right-point of the Battel was cover'd by the reſt of the Elephants, which were conducted by <hi>Myiſcus,</hi> who had been the King's Page.</p>
                     <p>In this order of Battel were the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies drawn up; while the two Kings, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by their Officers and Favourites, went from Rank to Rank to animate their Troops. But foraſmuch as they had plac'd their greateſt Confidence in their Phalanxes, which may be call'd Legionaries; to theſe therefore they were more earneſt in their Exhortations, wherein <hi>Soſibius</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe</hi> ſeconded <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> and <hi>Theodotus</hi> and <hi>Nicarchus, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus;</hi> who were Chiefs of the Legionaries of the one and the other Army. In ſhort, it may be concluded, that the Speeches of theſe two Princes were near the ſame, whereby to encourage their Troops; neither being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with ſtronger Reaſons than the other; for they were but young Kings, and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet done any thing very memorable, out of which to collect Matter for their Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; wherefore they labour'd to hearten them to the Battel, by laying before them the Prize of Glory that was to be won, and the Reputation of their Anceſtors; and above all, made large Promiſes of Rewards to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61906:402"/>in particular, and the Soldiers in general, to oblige them to their beſt performance in that occaſion. Thus then the two Kings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated their Armies, partly by themſelves, and partly by their Interpreters.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and his Siſter <hi>Arſinoe</hi> were come to the Left-Wing, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> to the Right of their two Armies, attended by their Guards, they ſounded to the Charge, and the Battel began with their Elephants: Some of thoſe Beaſts, on <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s part, came at firſt boldly on to the Attack; and the Men who fought from the Turrets behav'd themſelves well, fighting from thence with their Pikes; but the ſhock between the Elephants themſelves was more remarkable, thoſe Animals attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting one the other with an impetuoſity hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be repreſented; for they fight after this manner: They firſt make proof of their Strength by engaging with their Teeth, and with a firm foot keeping their Ground, preſs one againſt another with their utmoſt ſtrength, till by this contention one of them prevails, and compels the other to yield ground to his ſuperiour Strength; whereby the Trunk being turn'd aſide, he is forc'd, by endeavouring to diſengage himſelf, to expoſe his Side and Flank to his Enemy, who fails not to hit him there, goring him with his Tooth, as Bulls do with their Horns.</p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:61906:403"/>
                     <p>But it came to paſs, that <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants for the moſt part wanted Courage to ſtand the Shock; and as the Elephants of <hi>Libya,</hi> who can neither endure the Smell nor Braying of thoſe of <hi>India;</hi> ſo theſe, frighted at the Strength and Size of the others, turn'd their backs before they came near them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Regiment of Guards into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, who were drawn up behind them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom they fell. In the interim, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> leading about his Battalion of Guards; and getting before the Elephants, charg'd <hi>Polycrates</hi> at the head of the Horſe; and at the ſame time the Mercenary <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were poſted near the Phalanx, advanc'd againſt <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Buckler-men, whoſe Order had been already broken by the Elephants. The Left-Wing of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Army being by this means worſted, turn'd their backs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them to flight; but <hi>Echecrates,</hi> who commanded in the Right, and ſtood waiting to ſee the iſſue of the Diſpute between the two Points, whereof we have been ſpeaking, obſerving a thick Cloud of Duſt drive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and perceiving their Elephants would do nothing, commanded <hi>Phoxidas,</hi> who led the <hi>Greek</hi> Mercenaries, to advance, and charge thoſe that were oppos'd to him, while he led the Horſe about, and charge thoſe that were poſted behind the Elephants, and were cover'd by thoſe Animals; whereupon attacking the Enemies Horſe in Flank and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61906:403"/>Reer, they put them to flight. Nor was <hi>Phoxidas</hi> and thoſe with him leſs fortunate, who falling on the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Arabs,</hi> had the like ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Right-Wing of <hi>Antiochus</hi> beat, and the Left was beaten; and now albeit the Phalanxes on either ſide were depriv'd of their Points, they remain'd however entire, and held their Order, attending (betwixt Hope and Fear) the Event. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> we obſerv'd, where he fought on the Right, had the better; but <hi>Ptolomy</hi> retiring into the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx, and appearing in view of both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, much diſcourag'd the Enemy, and gave new Heart to his own People to proſecute the Battel; inſomuch, that <hi>Andromachus</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibius</hi> caus'd their Phalanx to charge their Pikes, and advance. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Soldiers did indeed for a while ſuſtain the Charge; but thoſe who were under <hi>Nicarchus</hi> hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the firſt Shock, were preſently bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and turn'd their backs. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> like a young Prince and unexperienc'd Captain, imagin'd becauſe they had beaten the Enemy where he fought, and purſu'd them, that the Victory had been entire; but he was ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiv'd by an old Officer, who advis'd him heedfully to conſider what that mighty Cloud of Duſt meant, that came from the middle Battel, driving towards the Camp; ſo that being ſoon given to underſtand the Succeſs, he haſtned towards his Camp, attended only
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61906:404"/>by his Troop of Guards; where finding his Army routed, he made ſpeed to <hi>Raphia,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Comfortable Perſuaſion only, that the Battel was not loſt through any Default of his, but by the Cowardice of his Soldiers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> thus winning the Day through the good Behaviour of the Phalanx, many of thoſe that fled being cut off by the Horſe and Mercenaries, who fought in the Right Wing, retir'd out of the Field, and remain'd that Night in the Camp. The next Day, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had caus'd the Dead on his ſide to be bury'd, and had ſtripp'd the Enemy that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd on the place, he Decamp'd, and March'd directly towards <hi>Raphia.</hi> In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Rallying and Forming into Troops ſuch as he found, who had fled out of the Field, would have Encamp'd without the Walls; but finding they were for the moſt part gotten already into the Town, he thought it beſt to retire himſelf in likewiſe; and early the next Morning, Marching out with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his Army, took his March towards <hi>Gaza;</hi> where after he had Encamp'd, he ſent to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to Demand the Bodies of thoſe that were ſlain; which being obtain'd, he caus'd their Funeral Rights to be perform.</p>
                     <p>In this Defeat, <hi>Antiochus</hi> loſt no leſs than ten thouſand Foot, and above three hundred Horſe, beſides Priſoners to the number of four thouſand: Thirteen of his Elephants were kill'd in Fight, two died after of their
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61906:404"/>Hurts. On the part of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> fell about two thouſand five hundred Foot, and ſeven hundred Horſe; 16 of his Elephants were kill'd, and the remainder moſt of them taken. This was the ſucceſs of the Battel that was fought near <hi>Raphia,</hi> for the Dominion of <hi>Caelo-Syria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <hi>Antiochus</hi> had caus'd the Slain to be buried, he March'd away with the reſt of his Army homeward, while <hi>Ptolomy</hi> receiv'd to his Obedience <hi>Raphia,</hi> and the other Towns, which contended which ſhould be firſt in their Submiſſion to the Conqueror. In ſhort, 'tis the Cuſtom of Mankind on the like occaſions, to Accommodate their Affairs to their preſent Fortune; but of all Countries, none produce Minds ſo pliable that way, as theſe of this Country, when Fortune will have it ſo; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that Nation being diſpos'd to a better liking of the Government of the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Kings, it was a leſs wonder that they ſo frankly gave themſelves up to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> And indeed thoſe of the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> have ever born a ſingular Veneration for the Royal Houſe of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Wherefore, to acquire the Good Will of this Prince, they forgot no ways of Flattery, Honouring him with Crowns, and Adoring him with Sacrifices and Altars, and doing all things of that Nature.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Antiochus</hi> was arriv'd at the City that bears his Name, he diſpatch'd <hi>Antipater</hi> his Nephew, and <hi>Theodotus Hemiolius,</hi> his Ambaſſadors to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to Negotiate a Peace;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61906:405"/>being doubtful leaſt his Enemies ſhould take the occaſion to Attack him; and having no great Truſt in the Multitude of his Subjects, by reaſon of his late Misfortune. He was jealous likewiſe, that <hi>Achoeus</hi> might make uſe of the Conjuncture to hurt him. As for <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> none of theſe Reflections imploy'd his Thoughts, who contenting himſelf with unexpected Victory, and pleas'd with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Recovery of the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Hopes, manifeſted a much greater inclination to Peace, than in Prudence he ought, through the natural Sloth that was in him, and the other Infirmities of Mind, to which he was ſubject through the whole courſe of his Life. Wherefore as ſoon as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater,</hi> and the reſt of that Commiſſion ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, he preſently conſented to a Years Truce, after having firſt ſaid ſome menacing things, and complain'd of the Injuries offer'd him by <hi>Antiochus:</hi> Then he diſpatch'd <hi>Soſibius</hi> to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Accord; and making about three Months ſtay in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and ſettle the Affairs of the ſeveral Towns and Cities, he left <hi>Andromachus</hi> the <hi>Aſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> his Governour in thoſe Provinces, and ſo departed for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with his Siſter and Favourites; having put a period to the War, to the great Wonder of his Subjects, who ſo well knew his Life and Manners. In concluſion, after <hi>Antiochus</hi> had Ratify'd the Treaty of <hi>Soſibius,</hi> he prepar'd for the War againſt <hi>Achoeus,</hi> as he had before determin'd.</p>

But this Calamity, by their Wiſdom, was Converted to a Benefit: So wide the difference is between the effects of thoughtleſs Negligence, and prudent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, whether it be in private or publick Affairs: For as the one often turns the beſt Succeſs into a Calamity; ſo the other can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Benefit out of the greateſt Diſaſters.

The <hi>Eleans,</hi> who were not pleas'd with <hi>Pyrrhias,</hi> procur'd to have his Place fill'd by <hi>Euripidas,</hi> who came to them from <hi>Aetolia;</hi> he taking the occaſion of the Aſſembly of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> drew out two thouſand Foot and threeſcore Horſe, and led them into the Territory of <hi>Pharoea,</hi> plundring and ſpoiling all along as he march'd as far as the Frontiers of the <hi>Aegeans,</hi> and having got much Booty, retir'd to <hi>Leontium, Lycus</hi> receiving Intelligence of what had paſs'd, march'd out and got before him, with deſign to make him quit his Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and Attacking him, kill'd above four hundred of his Party, and took two hundred Priſoners; among whom were <hi>Phyſſias, Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Clearchus, Euanoridas, Aristogiton, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſippus,</hi> and <hi>Aſpaſius,</hi> all Men of note; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over and above, their Arms and Baggage. At the ſame time the General of the <hi>Achaian</hi>

And in that Expedition he took much Plunder both by Sea and Land, which produc'd a great Summ of Money, and ſo great plenty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, that the Soldiers took better heart, in proſpect of better Pay; and the People aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to think, they ſhould be now exempt from Taxes and Contributions towards the War.</p>
                     <p>And now it came to paſs that <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> conceiving himſelf abus'd by King <hi>Philip,</hi> a good part of the Money that was due by the Stipulations that were concluded between them, being with held from him, fitted out a Squadron of fifteen Ships, with orders to take by repriſal, what by agreement was his due. This Squadron came to the Port of <hi>Leucas,</hi> where on account of old Friendſhip they were well receiv'd; and here indeed they acted no Hoſtility, having no occaſion given them. They took only <hi>Agathynus</hi> and <hi>Caſſander</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who arriv'd at the Port in Veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Taurion,</hi> and as Friends adventur'd into the Harbour; but theſe ſeizing the four Veſſels, and making them Priſoners, ſent them

                     <p>And now Harveſt approaching, and <hi>Tauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> taking no thought for ſupplying thoſe Towns we mention'd with Succours, <hi>Aratus</hi> therefore with a choſen Band of Soldiers march'd to aſſiſt the <hi>Argians</hi> in their Harveſt; and <hi>Euripidas</hi> drew out his <hi>Aetolians</hi> to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Lands of <hi>Tritoea.</hi> But <hi>Lycus</hi> and <hi>Demodochus,</hi> Generals of the <hi>Achaian</hi> Horſe, coming to underſtand that the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were march'd out of <hi>Elea,</hi> immediately gather'd a Body of Troops out of <hi>Dymas, Patroe,</hi> and <hi>Pharoea,</hi> whom joyning with the Mercenaries they had with them, they march'd and fell on the Lands of the <hi>Eleans;</hi> and drawing near to a Place call'd <hi>Phyxium,</hi> they order'd their Horſe and light-arm'd Troops to Forage the Country, concealing the reſt of their Forces in the foremention'd place; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Eleans</hi> marched all out againſt thoſe that ſpoil'd the Country, and purſued them who ſeem'd to fly. <hi>Lycus</hi> in the mean time riſes from his Ambuſh and attacks them, whom not able to withſtand, but facing about at the firſt ſight of them, the <hi>Achaians</hi> cut off to the number of two hundred, took about fourſcore Priſoners, and ſo march'd home in ſafety with all their Booty. He who commanded the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaian</hi> Fleet likewiſe, making ſeveral deſcents
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61906:410"/>on the Coaſt of <hi>Calydon</hi> and <hi>Naupactus,</hi> pillag'd at pleaſure all along the Country, and charg'd and routed in two occaſions the Forces that came to the relief: In one of which he took <hi>Cleonicus</hi> of <hi>Naupactus</hi> Priſoner, who was ſoon enlarg'd without Ranſom, as being a favourer of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> wherefore he was not ſold with the reſt on his being taken.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, <hi>Agetas</hi> the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor rais'd an Army out of his own Nation, with which marching into the Lands of the <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> after he had taken much Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he made Inroads and Forag'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and then return'd home, and diſmiſs'd the <hi>Aetolians</hi> to their ſeveral Towns. Upon this the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> invaded the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Stratus,</hi> where being ſurpriz'd with a cauſleſs Terror, they retreated back with ſhame, howbeit without loſs; the Country-People who made head againſt them, fearing to purſue them, jealous that their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the ſame time a piece of mock-Treaſon was acted in <hi>Phanotis,</hi> which was manag'd after this manner; <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> had plac'd his Governour in <hi>Phocis,</hi> contriv'd with <hi>Jaſon,</hi> whom he had made Governor of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notis,</hi> this ſtratagem to catch the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> he made <hi>Jaſon</hi> treat with <hi>Agetas,</hi> the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Praetor, about the betraying to him the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of that Place, which by Oath he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd; whereupon <hi>Agetas</hi> coming with his

                     <p>During theſe Tranſactions in <hi>Greece,</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> took the Town of <hi>Bylazor</hi> in <hi>Poeonia,</hi> which place commanded ſo intirely the way by which we go from <hi>Dardania</hi> into <hi>Macedon,</hi> that becoming Maſter thereof, he became thereby ſafe againſt all Attempts of the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danians;</hi> it being very difficult to invade <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> after <hi>Philip</hi> had got this Place into his poſſeſſion, which gave him all the Inlets to that Country. As ſoon as he had ſtrengthen'd it with a good Garriſon, he diſpatch'd <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> with expedition, to conduct a Body of new-rais'd Troops out of the <hi>

And what is more certain, than to ſee in theſe occaſions every omiſſion of our Duty puniſh'd? For the Error is no ſooner committed when we ſee the Damage, and feel the Effects, which appear in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Firſt, the braveſt and moſt forward Men are hereby moſt expos'd, who being by this means compell'd to retire, the Enemy
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61906:412"/>recovers heart and attacks them with aſſurance, and purſues them with advantage. This is confirm'd by infinite Examples; for of thoſe, who are forc'd to retire in ſuch occaſions, we ſhall find more to periſh, and be reduc'd to the utmoſt perils than to eſcape. And it muſt be confeſs'd, that ſuch as act thus weakly contract to themſelves the misfortune of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being afterwards truſted; incur a laſting hatred among the Soldiers, and teach the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to be more on his guard. And ſuch Errors do not only admoniſh the Spectators how to improve them, but afford inſtruction to thoſe who hear the relation. Wherefore all Officers and Leaders, who ſhall be ingag'd in the Conduct of the like Enterprizes, be hereby taught to proceed more regardfully. Nor is it difficult, by the help of a very little Science, to be Maſter of the means, whereby to compaſs exactly ſuch heights and meaſures, as import us to know with aſſurance, when we have ſuch deſigns to proſecute. But let us reſume our Diſcourſe, referring to another place what we purpoſe to deliver for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe who would not be deceiv'd when they engage in Actions of this nature.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Philip,</hi> hopeleſs of ſucceeding in his purpoſe here, drew off and encamp'd his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my along the River <hi>Enipeus;</hi> ordering to be brought from <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> and the other Towns, all ſuch Stores and Proviſions of War, as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Winter he had caus'd to be provided
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61906:412"/>for the ſervice of Sieges and attacking of Towns; his main deſign in the Expedition being to attempt the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> call'd <hi>Phthiotis.</hi> This place is ſituate near the Sea, diſtant about eight and thirty Miles from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa.</hi> 'Tis a Frontier of <hi>Magneſia</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> The Territory borders on <hi>Magneſia</hi> on the ſide towards <hi>Demetrias;</hi> on <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> towards that quarter that is inhabited by the <hi>Pharſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Pheroeans.</hi> But foraſmuch as the <hi>Aetolians</hi> were now Maſters of that Country, and from thence made inceſſant Inroads, they greatly annoy'd thoſe of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians</hi> and <hi>Lariſſoeans,</hi> ſpoiling and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as far as a place call'd the <hi>Fields of Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Philip,</hi> concluding the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize to be worth his while, reſolv'd to ſpare no application whereby to become Maſter of that place. In order to which, he had provided an hundred and fifty extraordinary Catapults, and five and twenty other Engines for caſting of Stones, and ſo march'd and ſat down before <hi>Thebes;</hi> and forming his Army into three Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, took poſſeſſion of the neareſt Poſts to the Town; one Diviſion being poſted on the Ground near <hi>Scopius,</hi> another about <hi>Heliotro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> and the third poſſeſs'd an Eminence that looks into the Town. Theſe three Camps he united by Lines of Communication, which he fortify'd with wooden Redoubts, ſtanding at about an hundred Paces diſtant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein he plac'd good Guards for their
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61906:413"/>defence. Then ſecuring all his Stores and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage of War in one place, he caus'd his Machines to be drawn out.</p>
                     <p>During the firſt three Days, the Inhabitants ſhew'd great aſſurance by the brave reſiſtance they made, whereby the Works advanc'd but little; but after by inceſſant Attacks, which kept them continually in action, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty number of Darts and Stones that had been caſt into the Town, whereby the better half of the Beſieged were either kill'd or wounded, their Reſolution began to fail, and the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> with more ſucceſs, advanc'd with their Mines. Howbeit, tho' they wrought with their utmoſt diligence, they were five Days gaining the foot of the Wall, the Ground proving ſo difficult. But in the end, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without intermiſſion Night and Day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving each other by Parties, they had ſapp'd about two hundred paces of the Wall, which they ſuſtain'd by ſtrong Poſts or Props of Timber. But it ſo happen'd, that theſe Props being not of ſufficient ſtrength to ſuſtain the Burthen, the Wall fell, before the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> could apply Fire to conſume them, as was their Cuſtom. Then they wrought a Mine under the Ruines, to make a paſſage into the Town; but as ſoon as the <hi>Thebans</hi> perceiv'd the Enemy preparing to force their entrance, they yielded. <hi>Philip</hi> by this ſucceſs having ſecur'd the Frontiers of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Magneſia,</hi> and taken much Booty from the <hi>Aetolians,</hi>
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:61906:413"/>his Army came then to confeſs, That <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had juſtly ſuffer'd; for it was now evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That he had not done his Duty as he ought, with the ſtrength he had at the Siege of <hi>Palaea.</hi>

                        <hi>Philip</hi> thus becoming Maſter of <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſold the Inhabitants, and re-peopling it with a Colony of <hi>Macedonians,</hi> chang'd its Name to <hi>Philippi.</hi> Thus having ſucceeded in all his Enterprizes, new Ambaſſadors came to him to treat about a Peace, on the part of the <hi>Rhodians;</hi> alſo from <hi>Chios,</hi> the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> and from <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf. But <hi>Philip</hi> reply'd, as he had done before, That he held the ſame diſpoſition to give a period to the War, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to apply to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> to know their purpoſe; but that in the interim he was reſolv'd to purſue his Enterprizes. In order to which, receiving intelligence that the Ships of <hi>Scerdilaidas</hi> infeſted the Sea about <hi>Malea;</hi> that they treated all the Trading-Veſſels as Enemies; and that contrary to the Treaty, they had ſeiz'd ſome of his own Subjects Ships in the Port of <hi>Leucas.</hi> He therefore Embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Euripus</hi> with a Fleet of fifty Sail great and ſmall; ſome equipp'd for War, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Veſſels of Burthen; with this force pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd with great diligence the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in his purpoſe to preſs the War againſt the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> being yet totally ignorant of Occurrences in <hi>Italy:</hi> For about the time that <hi>Philip</hi> held <hi>Thebes</hi> beſieg'd, the <hi>Romans</hi>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:61906:414"/>were beaten in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the news whereof had not yet reach'd <hi>Greece.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61906:414"/>Dominion, to which none had ſo great Right to pretend; and that the preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of the <hi>Romans</hi> was a fair and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable occaſion to incite him to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                     <p>Thus did <hi>Demetrius</hi> eaſily work on <hi>Philip,</hi> who was yet but young, and whoſe Affairs Fortune had hitherto eſpous'd; whoſe Mind was great, and he of a Race, that I, by I know not what kind of Deſtiny, above all others, yielded with caſe to the tranſportments of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Univerſal Dominion. <hi>Philip</hi> for the preſent, I ſay, communicated the news he had receiv'd to none but <hi>Demetrius:</hi> But ſoon after aſſembling his Friends, he fell to deliberate about a Peace with the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> to which <hi>Aratus</hi> appear'd well enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; weighing, that by how much they had the better in the War, by ſo much was it likely they ſhould better their Terms in a Treaty of Peace.

And having now his Mind total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wean'd from the War, he diſpatch'd Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the reſpective Cities of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, exhorting them to haſten their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Aſſembly, to deliberate together about Peace. In the interim, he imbark'd his Army for <hi>Panormus,</hi> a Port-Town of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſus,</hi> lying againſt <hi>Naupactus,</hi> where he Encamp'd, reſolving to attend the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Ambaſſadors, who were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Aſſembly.

                     <p>As ſoon as the Aſſembly was full, King <hi>Philip</hi> diſpatch'd <hi>Aratus, Taurion,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others who had accompany'd them to the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> who at the ſame time held a General Aſſembly of their States at <hi>Naupactus,</hi> whither the Ambaſſadors likewiſe came; and after ſome Conference, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came aſſur'd of the <hi>Aetolians</hi> being ſincerely diſpos'd to a Peace, they return'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the News to <hi>Philip.</hi> But the <hi>Aetolians</hi> being in good earneſt to put a period to that War, accompany'd them with their own Ambaſſadors, to perſuade the King to come
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61906:415"/>over with his Army into <hi>Aetolia,</hi> to the end they might by conference give an iſſue to the Affair, which would be expedited with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eaſe, when he ſhould be ſo near. <hi>Philip</hi> mov'd by their Intreaties, paſs'd over with his Troops, and came to a place within leſs than a League of <hi>Naupactus,</hi> where he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd; and ſecuring his Army and Fleet with a good Retrenchment there, attended the reſult of their Debates. In the mean while, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> came flocking to them in Multitudes, confidently and without Arms. And becauſe the place of Treaty was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a quarter of a Mile from <hi>Philip</hi>'s Camp, they held continual intercourſe with him, by Perſons impower'd by them to treat; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while, the King ſent to them the whole Body of the Confederate Ambaſſadors, with Inſtructions to to yield a Peace with the <hi>Aeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> on condition principally, that each Party ſhould be confirm'd in the poſſeſſion of the Places then held. After the <hi>Aetolians</hi> had declar'd their Conſent to the Propoſition, they enter'd into Debates touching the Articles that had regard to each one in particular: But of that we ſhall make no mention, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little of Importance, and ſhall only recite the Terms of a Remonſtrance, made by <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> of <hi>Naupactus,</hi> to the King and the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, on their opening the Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>He told them, that nothing ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as to ſhun all occaſions of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61906:416"/>War among themſelves; and that they ought to render Thanks to the Gods, that becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now of one Mind, and leading each other as it were by the hand, like thoſe who ford a River, they have obtain'd a proſpect of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the general Defence of themſelves and their Cities againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whoſe Deſigns they had ſo much cauſe to apprehend. That albeit they ſhould not be able to give perpetuity to the preſent Union among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it behov'd them at leaſt in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, to agree as one Man in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Common Safety; ſince none could be ignorant of the ſtrength of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> and the mighty War they were like to have on their hands with that People. That none, how unacquainted ſoever in the Affairs of the Commonwealth, but muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that nothing was more probable, than that whether the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> vanquiſh'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in the preſent War, the Conquerors would not reſt ſatisfy'd with the Dominion of <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>Sicily,</hi> but proſecute their Deſigns further than they would be willing; and at length as far as <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf: Wherefore he exhorted them, eſpecially King <hi>Philip,</hi> to have an eye to the Danger that threatned them; that the Task would not be inſuperable, if inſtead of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Forces of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as he had hitherto done; and rendring them by that means an eaſier Prey to their Enemies; he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61906:416"/>would now lay their Affairs to heart, and do for them as for himſelf, and act in behalf of the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Nation, as if <hi>Greece</hi> were his Inheritance. That if he ſo conducted his Councils, he ſhould have no cauſe to doubt of acquiring the general Affection of that People; of being by them abetted, and aſſiſted, in all his Deſigns; and that Foreigners, terrify'd at the Firmneſs of their Fidelity to him, would be cautious how they invaded him. That if his Mind was bent on great Enterprizes, and he thirſted after Glory, he ſhould extend his Proſpect towards the Weſt, and contemplate the War that had ſet all <hi>Italy</hi> in a flame; that he ſhould watch the Event, and improve it to his advantage; and when Time ſhould ripen his Affairs, generouſly aſpire to the Dominion of the World. That the preſent Conjuncture did not impugn that Deſign. In concluſion, he pray'd him, that if it were ſo that he had any remains of Diſpleaſure againſt any of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which might diſpoſe him to new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities, he would reſpite his Purpoſe to a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of more leiſure, and ſo provide that it might be always in his Power to renew, and give a period to the War with them. For if once he ſuffer'd the Tempeſt that was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Weſt to reach <hi>Greece,</hi> it might juſtly be fear'd, that all theſe Treaties, Leagues, and Wars, which, as it were in paſtime, had hitherto entertain'd them, would be then ſo little in their choice, that they might come
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61906:417"/>one day to aſcribe it to the great Favour of the Gods, to be able to determine among themſelves of Peace and War; and to have it equally in their power, as their Wiſh, to be Judges of their own Differences.</p>
                     <p>This Speech of <hi>Agelaus</hi> prevail'd with the Confederates, eſpecially King <hi>Philip,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Peace more earneſtly. For he, who was already ſhaken by the Counſels of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> heard nothing from <hi>Agelaus</hi> that did not ſort to his purpoſe. Wherefore after he had adjuſted the Conditions with the <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſign'd the Treaty, every one return'd home, carrying with them Peace in exchange for War. Theſe things came to paſs, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Defeat of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> the War of <hi>Antiochus</hi> for the <hi>Lower Syria,</hi> and the Peace of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and the <hi>Achaians,</hi> with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> in the third Year of the Hundred and fortieth Olympiad; about which time it was, that the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> began to mix and have relation with thoſe of <hi>Greece.</hi> For after this, neither K. <hi>Philip,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Greek</hi> Princes, form'd any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or amus'd themſelves about Peace or War in <hi>Greece;</hi> but all had their Eyes ſix'd on <hi>Italy,</hi> as the Object of every one's Attention. And it was not long before the ſeveral People inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the Iſles of <hi>Aſia,</hi> acted the ſame part; for thoſe who cou'd not brook the growing Greatneſs of <hi>Philip,</hi> and others who had any Conteſts with <hi>Attalus,</hi> had no more recourſe
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61906:417"/>to <hi>Antiochus</hi> or <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to Southern or Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Princes, but had their Proſpect Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; ſome ſending their Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> others to the <hi>Romans.</hi> In like ſort, the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, awakned by the Power and Proweſs of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and being willing to obviate betimes the Danger that might grow from that Prince's Enmity, who might add new Evils to thoſe which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſorely preſs'd them on all ſides; reſolv'd to diſpatch Ambaſſadors into <hi>Greece.</hi> But foraſmuch as we have already clearly explain'd, at what time, by what means, and what Counſels the Affairs of <hi>Greece</hi> came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with thoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> after we ſhall have continued to relate the Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Greece,</hi> to the time when the <hi>Romans</hi> were defeated at <hi>Cannoe,</hi> where we brake off our Diſcourſe of the Occurrences of <hi>Italy,</hi> we purpoſe to finiſh this Book.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the Peace was ratify'd, and the <hi>Achaians</hi> had created <hi>Timoxenus</hi> their Praetor, they return'd to their old Manners and courſe of Life; and the reſt of the Towns of <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> in like ſort, fell to repair their publick and private Damages, to cultivate their Ground, re-edifie their Altars, eſtabliſh their Worſhip, and reſtore their Laws and Cuſtoms. All which had been near utterly ruin'd and made deſolate through the long War they had ſuſtain'd: It having been the fate of the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſians,</hi> (who of all others are moſt diſpos'd to a Life of Eaſe and Tranquility) to enjoy
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61906:418"/>leſs of that Bleſſing than their Neighbours; and of whom it may be ſaid with <hi>Euripides,</hi>
                        <q>Whoſe Life with War and endleſs Toil, is vex'd.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is it more than what in my Judgment ſeems reaſonable to expect ſhould befal them; for what is more probable, than that a People aſpiring after Dominion, jealous of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and who would yield Precedence to none, ſhould be ever embroil'd in Hoſtilities. One would have thought that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were deliver'd from their Fears of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> ſhould have been at caſe, and eſtabliſh'd their Security on ſure and laſting Foundations; yet ſo it happen'd, that giving themſelves up to the Counſels and Conduct of <hi>Euryclidas</hi> and <hi>Micyon,</hi> and ſecluding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Society of the other Cities of <hi>Greece;</hi> what Fla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For after that Prince had put the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in Arms againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> wherein he was not ill-advis'd, if regard only were to be had to the occaſion that then preſs'd him; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel ſhew'd, that nothing could have been
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61906:418"/>more pernicious with reſpect to the future. For the <hi>Egyptians</hi> growing proud and over-weaning of their Strength, after the Victory at <hi>Raphia,</hi> grew to withdraw their Obedience from the King; and conceiving their Power ſufficient to withſtand him, waited only for a fit Perſon to head them, to proceed to a Rebellion; and in ſhort, did rebell ſoon after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who, during Winter, had made mighty Proviſion for the War, early in the Spring paſs'd over Mount <hi>Taurus;</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into League with <hi>Attalus,</hi> proſecuted the War againſt <hi>Achoeus.</hi> The <hi>Aetolians,</hi> to whom the War had not prov'd ſo fortunate as they had hop'd, were for a while well enough pleas'd with Peace; and, on that Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they choſe <hi>Agelaus</hi> of <hi>Naupactus</hi> Praetor, whom they believ'd to have been mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the Pacification between them and the <hi>Achaians;</hi> nevertheleſs, it was not long before that Peace diſtaſted them, and their Complaints brake out againſt <hi>Agelaus;</hi> murmuring, that they had now loſt all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of bettering their Fortune, and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by the Spoils of Strangers; and were become hopeleſs for the time to come, the Peace not being particular with ſome few Towns, but with the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Nation. But their Praetor, with wiſe Patience, enduring their fooliſh Reproaches, ſo modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Heats, that they ſubmitted to his Authority, tho' with repugnance enough.</p>

                     <p>As ſoon as the Peace was ratify'd, King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> return'd by Sea to <hi>Macedon;</hi> where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> who had already ſeiz'd certain Veſſels in the Port of <hi>Leucas,</hi> had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunder'd <hi>Piſſoeum,</hi> a Town of <hi>Pelagonia,</hi> with the ſame Proetext as before, of paying himſelf the Money that remain'd due; that he had further drawn to his Party the Towns of <hi>Daſſaretis;</hi> that by Promiſes he had allur'd the People of <hi>Phoebatis;</hi> as, namely, <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, Chryſondiona,</hi> and <hi>Gertunta;</hi> and had made Inroads on the <hi>Macedonians: Philip</hi> therefore firſt led his Troops againſt the revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Towns, with Reſolution however not to delay his march againſt <hi>Scerdilaidas,</hi> judging it to be of great moment to compoſe the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Illyria,</hi> in order to the Enterprizes he had conceiv'd, eſpecially his Voyage into <hi>Italy.</hi> For <hi>Demetrius</hi> had ſo kindled his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, that it became his meditation Night and Day, and was the ſubject of his Dreams, talking in his ſleep of a War in <hi>Italy.</hi> While yet theſe Inſtigations grew not from the Love he bare to <hi>Philip,</hi> whoſe Affairs he little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, but from his Hatred to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and a Regard to his own Ends, conceiving there was now no other means left him, whereby to regain his Dominion of the Iſland of <hi>Pharus.</hi> In concluſion, <hi>Philip</hi> departing with his Army, recover'd the Places we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, together with <hi>Creonium,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runte</hi> in <hi>Daſſaretis:</hi> And beſides thoſe, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelanoe,

                     <p>King <hi>Philip,</hi> in the mean time, calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that to further the Enterprizes he was projecting, he ſhould ſtand in need of a good Supply of Ships and Sea-men; not that he conceiv'd himſelf a Match for the <hi>Romans</hi> by Sea, but to enable him to embark and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Troops, where he ſhould think it beſt, whereby to take the Enemy by ſurprize, and when they leaſt ſuſpected him: Wherefore, finding the Veſſels of the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Faſhion were propereſt for his uſe, he caus'd forthwith an hundred of that ſort to be built; and was one of the firſt <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings who had order'd ſo great a Fleet to be provided. After he had rigg'd and equipp'd them with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, he aſſembled his Troops about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Summer; and when he had exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd his <hi>Macedonians</hi> a while in the Uſe of the Oar, he put to Sea.

                     <p>After <hi>Philip</hi> had paſs'd down the <hi>Euripus</hi> with his Army, and doubled the Cape of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea,</hi> he arriv'd near <hi>Leucas,</hi> ſailing by <hi>Cephal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenia;</hi> when taking Harbour, he remain'd watching the Motions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a careful eye to every thing.

The next Morning arriving at <hi>Cephallenia,</hi> and being recover'd from his Fear, he told his People, That certain Affairs, that imported him to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61906:420"/>negotiate in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> had made him change his Purpoſe. The News however that had ſo terrify'd <hi>Philip,</hi> was not entirely falſe; for <hi>Scerdilaidas</hi> being inform'd of <hi>Philip</hi>'s great Naval Preparations during the Winter, had concluded that his Deſign was to fall on him: He had therefore given advice thereof to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and pray'd Succours from them; ſo that the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſent him ten Veſſels out of the Fleet at <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> which Squadron was ſeen at <hi>Rhegium</hi> as they paſs'd by: And if <hi>Philip</hi>'s Surprize had been leſs, he might have ſucceeded better in his <hi>Illyrian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. Furthermore, it is not improbable but that the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, who were humbled by their Loſs at <hi>Cannoe,</hi> might have fallen into his hands: But being terrify'd at the News, he made the beſt of his way to <hi>Macedon;</hi> without Loſs indeed, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reproach.</p>
                     <p>But what <hi>Pruſias'</hi> did about the ſame time, merits to be recorded to his great Honour: Thoſe <hi>Gauls</hi> whom <hi>Attalus</hi> had drawn out of <hi>Europe</hi> (having an extraordinary Opinion of their Bravery) to proſecute the War againſt <hi>Achoeus,</hi> having deſerted his Service, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we have elſewhere noted, fell to ſpoil and plunder the Towns about the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> wherein they proceeded with great Violence and Cruelty; and coming to lay ſiege to the <hi>Ilians,</hi> the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> who inhabited the neighbouring Country, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61906:421"/>with great Reputation on that occaſion; for ſending out <hi>Themiſtas</hi> at the head of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, he did not only raiſe the Siege, but forc'd the Enemy quite our of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, by cutting off their Convoys, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing other ways their Deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the <hi>Gauls,</hi> having taken <hi>Arisba,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Abydenians,</hi> attempted other Places of that Country, vexing them with continual Hoſtilities.
